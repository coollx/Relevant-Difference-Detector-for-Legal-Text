A Party or an agency of a Party that is subrogated to a right of an investor in accordance with paragraph 1 is entitled to the same rights as those of the investor regarding the investment.

          <p>1. Except as set out in this Article, this Agreement does not apply to a taxation measure.</p>
          <p>2. This Agreement does not affect the rights and obligations of a Party under a tax convention. In the event of inconsistency between this Agreement and a tax convention, that convention prevails.</p>
          <p>3. This Agreement does not require a Party to furnish or allow access to information that, if disclosed, would be contrary to the Party's law protecting information concerning the taxation affairs of a taxpayer.</p>
          <p>4. Subject to paragraph 2, the provisions of Articles 4 (National Treatment) and 5 (Most- Favoured-Nation Treatment) apply to all taxation measures, other than those on income, capital gains or on the taxable capital of corporations, except that nothing in those Articles shall apply:</p>
          <p>1. to a non-conforming provision of an existing taxation measure;</p>
          <p>2. to the continuation or prompt renewal of a non-conforming provision of an existing taxation measure;</p>

          <p>5. Provided that the conditions in paragraph 6 are met:</p>
          <p>1. a claim by an investor that a taxation measure of a Party is in breach of an agreement between a national government authority of that Party and the investor concerning an investment shall be considered a claim for breach of this Agreement; and</p>
          <p>2. the provisions of Article 10 (Expropriation) apply to taxation measures.</p>
          <p>6. An investor may not make a claim under paragraph 5 unless:</p>
          <p>1. the investor provides a copy of the notice of claim to the taxation authorities of the Parties; and</p>
          <p>2. six months after receiving notification of the claim by the investor, the taxation authorities of the Parties fail to reach a joint determination that, in the case of subparagraph 5(a), the measure does not contravene that agreement, or in the case of subparagraph 5(b), the measure in question is not an expropriation.</p>
          <p>7. If, in connection with a claim by an investor of a Party or a dispute between the Parties, an issue arises as to whether a measure of a Party is a taxation measure, a Party may refer the issue to the taxation authorities of the Parties. A decision of the taxation authorities shall bind a Tribunal formed pursuant to Section C (Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and the Host Party) or arbitral panel formed pursuant to Section D (State-to-State Dispute Settlement Procedures). A Tribunal or arbitral panel seized of a claim or a dispute in which the issue arises may not proceed until it receives the decision of the taxation authorities. If the taxation authorities have not decided the issue within six months of the referral, the Tribunal or arbitral panel shall decide the issue.</p>

        <div type="article" num="15" title="Health, safety and environmental measures">
          <p>The Parties recognize that it is inappropriate to encourage investment by relaxing domestic health, safety or environmental measures. Accordingly, a Party should not waive or otherwise derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from, those measures to encourage the establishment, acquisition, expansion or retention in its territory of an investment of an investor. If a Party considers that the other Party has offered such an encouragement, it may request consultations with the other Party and the two Parties shall consult with a view to avoiding the encouragement.</p>

          <p>2. Arbitrators shall have expertise or experience in public international law, international investment or international trade rules, or the resolution of disputes arising under international investment or international trade agreements. Arbitrators shall be independent of the disputing parties, impartial, free of any real or perceived conflicts of interest, and not be affiliated with or take instructions from either of the disputing parties.</p>
          <p>3. If the disputing parties do not agree on the remuneration of the arbitrators before the Tribunal is constituted, the prevailing ICSID rate for arbitrators shall apply.</p>
          <p>4. If a Tribunal, other than a Tribunal established under Article 29 (Consolidation), has not been constituted within 90 days from the date that a claim is submitted to arbitration, a disputing party may ask the Secretary-General of ICSID to appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed. The Secretary-General of ICSID shall make the appointment at his or her own discretion and, to the extent practicable, in consultation with the disputing parties.

          <p>4. A Tribunal established under this Article shall be established under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and shall conduct its proceedings in accordance with those Rules, except as modified by this Section.</p>
          <p>5. If a Tribunal established under this Article is satisfied that claims submitted to arbitration under Article 25 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration) have a question of law or fact in common, the Tribunal may, in the interest of fair and efficient resolution of the claims and after hearing the disputing parties, by order:</p>
          <p>1. assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine together, all or part of the claims; or</p>
          <p>2. assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine one or more of the claims, the determination of which it believes would assist in resolving the other claims.</p>

          <p>9. On application of a disputing party, a Tribunal established under this Article, pending its decision under paragraph 5, may order that the proceedings of a Tribunal established under Article 25 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration) be stayed unless the latter Tribunal has already adjourned its proceedings.</p>

          <p>1. The respondent Party shall deliver to the other Party a copy of the notice of intent to submit a claim to arbitration and other documents within 30 days of the date those documents have been delivered to the respondent Party. The other Party is entitled, at its expense, to receive from the respondent Party a copy of the evidence that has been tendered to the Tribunal, copies of pleadings filed in the arbitration, and the written argument of the disputing parties. The Party receiving such information shall treat the information as if it were a respondent Party.</p>
          <p>2. The other Party has the right to attend hearings held under this Section. Upon written notice to the disputing parties, the other Party may make submissions to the Tribunal on questions of interpretation of this Agreement.</p>

        <div type="article" num="31" title="Place of arbitration">
          <p>The disputing parties may agree on the place of arbitration under the arbitral rules applicable under Article 25(1) (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration) or 29(4) (Consolidation).

All other documents submitted to, or issued by, the Tribunal shall be publicly available unless the disputing parties otherwise agree, subject to the redaction of confidential information.</p>
          <p>2. Hearings held under this Section shall be open to the public. The Tribunal may hold portions of hearings in camera to the extent necessary to ensure the protection of confidential information.</p>
          <p>3. A disputing party may disclose to other persons in connection with the arbitral proceedings such unredacted documents as it considers necessary for the preparation of its case, but it shall ensure that those persons protect the confidential information in those documents.</p>
          <p>4. The Parties may share with officials of their respective national and sub-national governments all relevant unredacted documents in the course of dispute settlement under this Section, but they shall ensure that those persons protect the confidential information in those documents.</p>
          <p>5. If a Tribunal's order designates information as confidential and a Party's law on access to information requires public access to that information, the Party's law on access to information prevails. However, the Party should try to apply its law on access to information so as to protect information that the Tribunal's order has designated as confidential.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="33" title="Submissions by a non-disputing party">
          <p>A Tribunal has the authority to consider and accept written submissions from a person or entity that is not a disputing party with a significant interest in the arbitration.

When the respondent Party asserts as a defence that the measure alleged to be a breach is within the scope of a reservation or exception set out in Article 17(1) (Reservations and Exceptions), or Annexe II (Reservations for Future Measures) or III (Exceptions from Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), the Tribunal shall, at the request of that Party, request the joint interpretation of the Parties on the issue. Within 60 days of the delivery of the request, the Parties shall submit in writing their joint interpretation to the Tribunal. If the Parties fail to submit their joint interpretation within 60 days of the Tribunal's request, the Tribunal shall decide the issue. The joint interpretation is binding on the Tribunal.</p>

          <p>2. The Tribunal may not appoint an expert under paragraph 1 if the disputing parties agree that the Tribunal may not do so. The disputing parties are encouraged to provide the Tribunal with the reasons for such an agreement.</p>
          <p>3. Paragraph 1 does not affect the appointment of other kinds of experts where the appointment is authorized by the applicable arbitration rules.</p>

A Tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 21 (Claim by an Investor of a Party on Its Own Behalf or on Behalf of an Enterprise). For the purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a recommendation.</p>
          <p>2. Where a Tribunal makes a final award against the respondent Party, the Tribunal may award, separately or in combination, only:</p>
          <p>1. monetary damages and any applicable interest; and</p>
          <p>2. restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide that the respondent Party may pay monetary damages and any applicable interest in lieu of restitution.</p>
          <p>The Tribunal may also award costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.</p>

          <p>1. A dispute between the Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be settled, if possible, through diplomatic channels.</p>
          <p>2. If a dispute cannot be settled through diplomatic channels, the dispute is submitted to a joint commission composed of the representatives of each Party. The joint commission shall meet without delay, by any technological means available, at the request of one of the Parties. If the joint commission is unable to settle the dispute within six months of the date that the Parties request a joint commission, the dispute shall, at the request of a Party, be submitted to an arbitral panel for decision.</p>
          <p>3. Within two months after receipt through diplomatic channels of the request for arbitration, each Party shall appoint one member to the arbitral panel.

The Chair shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two members of the arbitral panel.</p>
          <p>4. If within the periods specified in paragraph 3 the necessary appointments have not been made, a Party may invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President is a national of a Party or is prevented from discharging that function for another reason, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of a Party or is prevented from discharging this function for another reason, the Member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of a Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>

Where a Party determines that the dispute involves measures relating to financial institutions, or to investors or investments of such investors in financial institutions, or where a Party invokes Article 11(6) (Transfers), 18(2) or 18(3) (General Exceptions), the arbitrators shall, in addition to the criteria set out in paragraph 5, have expertise or experience in financial services law or practice, which may include the regulation of financial institutions.</p>

Unless otherwise agreed, the decision of the arbitral panel shall be rendered within six months of the appointment of the Chair.</p>
          <p>8. Each Party shall bear the costs of its own member of the panel and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings. The costs related to the Chair and any remaining costs shall be borne equally by the Parties. The arbitral panel may, however, award that a higher proportion of costs be borne by one of the two Parties, and this award shall be binding on both Parties.</p>
          <p>9. Within 60 days of the decision of an arbitral panel, the Parties shall agree on the manner in which to resolve their dispute.

        </p>
        <p>The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:</p>
        <p>1. indirect expropriation results from a measure or a series of measures of a Party that has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure;</p>
        <p>2. the determination of whether a measure or a series of measures of a Party constitutes an indirect expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:</p>
        <p>a. the economic impact of the measure or the series of measures, although the sole fact that a measure or a series of measures of a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred,</p>
        <p>b. the extent to which the measure or the series of measures interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations, and</p>
        <p>c. the character of the measure or the series of measures;</p>
        <p>3. a non-discriminatory measure or series of measures of a Party designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as health, safety and the environment, does not constitute indirect expropriation, except in rare circumstances, such as when a measure or a series of measures is so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably considered as having been adopted and applied in good faith.</p>

        </p>
        <p>1. The person or entity seeking amicus curiae status must serve the Tribunal and all the disputing parties with an application for leave to file an amicus curiae submission and the proposed oral representations.</p>
        <p>2. An application for leave to file an amicus curiae submission must:</p>
        <p>1. be made in writing, and be dated and signed by the person or entity that files the application, and include the address and other contact details of the applicant. The person or entity may be represented by counsel for this purpose;</p>

        <p>4. The Tribunal will set an appropriate date for the disputing parties to comment on the application for leave to file an amicus curiae submission.</p>
        <p>5. In determining whether to grant leave to file an amicus curiae submission, the Tribunal must consider, among other things, the extent to which:</p>
        <p>1. the amicus curiae submission would assist the Tribunal to dispose of a question of fact or question of law related to the dispute;</p>

        <p>3. the amicus curiae has a significant interest in the arbitration; and</p>
        <p>4. the subject of the arbitration is a matter of public interest.</p>
        <p>6. The Tribunal must ensure that:</p>
        <p>1. any amicus curiae submissions does not disrupt the proceedings; and</p>
        <p>2. any amicus curiae submissions do not unfairly prejudice either disputing party.</p>
        <p>7. The Tribunal decides whether to grant leave to file an amicus curiae submission. If leave to file an amicus curiae submission is granted, the Tribunal sets an appropriate date for the disputing parties and the other Party to respond in writing to the amicus curiae submission.</p>
        <p>8. A Tribunal that grants leave to file an amicus curiae submission is not required to address all aspects of the submission in the arbitration. The Tribunal may ask any person or entity to make oral representations before the Tribunal before it answers specific questions or questions regarding the amicus curiae submission.</p>
        <p>9. Access to hearings and documents by persons or entities who apply for leave to file an amicus curiae submission in accordance with the procedures set out in this Annex is governed by the provisions pertaining to public access to hearings and documents under this Agreement.</p>
