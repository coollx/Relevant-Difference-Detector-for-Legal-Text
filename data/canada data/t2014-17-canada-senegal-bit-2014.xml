          <p>5.  Paragraph 4 does not prevent a Party from imposing a measure through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of its domestic law relating to the matters in subparagraphs 3(a) through 3(e).</p>
          <p>6.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 4, and without limiting the applicability of paragraph 5, a Party may prevent or limit transfers by a financial institution to, or for the benefit of, an affiliate of or person related to that institution, through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of a measure relating to maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or financial responsibility of financial institutions.</p>
          <p>7.  Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a Party may restrict transfers of returns in kind in circumstances where it could otherwise restrict those transfers under the WTO Agreement and as set out in paragraph 3.</p>

          <p>1.

          <p>2.  A Party or an agency of a Party, that is subrogated to a right of an investor in accordance with paragraph 1, is entitled to the same rights as those of the investor regarding the investment. Those rights may be exercised by the Party or an agency of the Party or by the investor if the Party or its agency so authorizes.</p>

          <p>(c)  to an amendment to a non-conforming provision of an existing taxation measure to the extent that the amendment does not decrease its conformity with those Articles at the time when the amendment is introduced; or</p>
          <p>(d)  to new taxation measures that are aimed at ensuring the equitable and effective imposition or collection of taxes (including, for greater certainty, a measure that is taken by a Party to ensure compliance with the Party's taxation system or to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes) and that do not arbitrarily discriminate between persons, goods or services of the Parties.</p>
          <p>5.  Provided that the conditions in paragraph 6 are met:</p>
          <p>(a)  on the one hand, a claim by an investor that a taxation measure of a Party is in breach of an agreement between a national government authority of that Party and the investor concerning an investment shall be considered a claim for breach of this Agreement; and</p>
          <p>(b)  on the other hand, the provisions of Article 10 (Expropriation) apply to taxation measures.</p>
          <p>6.  An investor may not make a claim under paragraph 5 unless:</p>
          <p>(a)  the investor provides a copy of the notice of claim to the taxation authorities of the Parties; and</p>
          <p>(b)  six months after receiving notification of the claim by the investor, the taxation authorities of the Parties fail to reach a joint determination that, in the case of subparagraph 5(a), the measure does not contravene that agreement, or in the case of subparagraph 5(b), the measure in question is not an expropriation.</p>
          <p>7.  If, in connection with a claim by an investor of a Party or a dispute between the Parties, an issue arises as to whether a measure of a Party is a taxation measure, a Party may refer the issue to the taxation authorities of the Parties. A decision of the taxation authorities shall bind a Tribunal formed pursuant to Section C (Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and the Host Party) or an arbitral panel formed pursuant to Section D (State-to-State Dispute Settlement Procedures). A Tribunal or arbitral panel seized of a claim or a dispute in which the issue arises may not proceed until it receives the decision of the taxation authorities. If the taxation authorities have not decided the issue within six months of the referral, the Tribunal or arbitral panel shall decide the issue.</p>
          <p>8.  Each Party shall notify the other Party by diplomatic note of the identity of the taxation authorities referred to in this Article.</p>

        <div type="article" num="15" title="Health, safety and environmental measures">
          <p>The Parties recognize that it is inappropriate to encourage investment by relaxing domestic health, safety or environmental measures. Accordingly, a Party should not waive or otherwise derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from, those measures to encourage the establishment, acquisition, expansion or retention in its territory of an investment of an investor. If a Party considers that the other Party has offered such an encouragement, it may request consultations with the other Party and the two Parties shall consult with a view to avoiding the encouragement.</p>

        <div type="article" num="16" title="Corporate social responsibility">
          <p>Each Party should encourage enterprises operating within its territory or subject to its jurisdiction to voluntarily incorporate internationally recognized standards of corporate social responsibility in their practices and internal policies, such as statements of principle that have been endorsed or are supported by the Parties. These principles address issues such as labour, the environment, human rights, community relations and anti-corruption. Such enterprises are encouraged to make investments whose impacts contribute to the resolution of social problems and preserve the environment.</p>

          <p>1.  The respondent Party shall deliver to the other Party a copy of the notice of intent to submit a claim to arbitration and other documents within 30 days of the date those documents have been delivered to the respondent Party. The other Party is entitled, at its cost, to receive from the respondent Party a copy of the evidence that has been tendered to the Tribunal, copies of pleadings filed in the arbitration, and the written argument of the disputing parties. The Party receiving such information shall treat the information as if it were a respondent Party.</p>
          <p>2.  The other Party has the right to attend hearings held under this Section. Upon written notice to the disputing parties, the other Party may make submissions to a Tribunal on questions of interpretation of this Agreement.</p>

The Parties may share with officials of their respective national and subnational governments all relevant unredacted documents in the course of dispute settlement under this Section, but they shall ensure that those persons protect the confidential information in those documents.</p>
          <p>5.  If a Tribunal's order designates information as confidential and a Party's law on access to information requires public access to that information, the Party's law on access to information prevails. However, the Party should try to apply its law on access to information so as to protect information that the Tribunal's order has designated as confidential.</p>

        <p>The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:</p>
        <p>(a)  indirect expropriation results from a measure or a series of measures of a Party that has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure;</p>
        <p>(b)  the determination of whether a measure or a series of measures of a Party constitutes an indirect expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:</p>
        <p>(i) The economic impact of the measure or the series of measures, although the sole fact that a measure or a series of measures of a Party have an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred,</p>
        <p>(ii) The extent to which the measure or the series of measures interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations, and</p>
        <p>(iii) The character of the measure or the series of measures;</p>
        <p>(c)  except in rare circumstances, such as when a measure or a series of measures is so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith, a non-discriminatory measure of a Party that is designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as health, safety and the environment, does not constitute indirect expropriation.</p>
