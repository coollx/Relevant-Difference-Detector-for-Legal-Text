      <p>The Republic of Turkey and the Republic of South Africa</p>
      <p>(hereinafter jointly referred to as the "Parties", and in the singular as a "Party"),</p>
      <p>Desiring to promote greater economic cooperation between them, particularly with respect to investment by investors of one Party in the territory of the other Party,</p>
      <p>Recognizing that agreement upon the treatment to be accorded such investment will stimulate the flow of capital and technology and the economic development of the Parties,</p>
      <p>Agreeing that fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment and maximum effective utilization of economic resources, and</p>
      <p>Having resolved to conclude an agreement concerning the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments,</p>
      <p>Hereby agree as follows:</p>
    </preamble>
    <body>

        <p>The said term shall refer to all direct investments made in accordance with the domestic law in the territory of the Party where the investments are made. A change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect their character as investments. 3.

        <p>4. "Territory" means with regard to either Party, its territory, territorial sea, as well as the maritime areas over which it has jurisdiction or sovereign rights for the purpose of exploration, exploitation and preservation of natural resources, pursuant to international law;</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="IV" title="Repatriation and Transfer">

        <p>3. Disputes between a Party and an insurer shall be settled in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="VI" title="Application of other Rules and Special Commitments">
        <p>If the provisions of the domestic law of either Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Parties in addition to this Agreement contain rules, whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors of the other Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by this Agreement, such rules shall to the extent that they are more favourable prevail over this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="VII" title="Settlement of Disputes between One Party and Investors of the other Party">
        <p>1. Disputes between one of the Parties and an investor of the other Party, in connection with his investment, shall be notified in writing, including a detailed information, by the investor to the recipient Party of the investment. As far as possible, the investor and the concerned Party shall endeavour to settle these disputes by consultations and negotiations in good faith.</p>
        <p>2. If these disputes, cannot be settled in this way within six months following the date of the written notification referred to in sub article 1, the investor shall be entitled to submit the case either to:</p>
        <p>(a) The International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) set up by the Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington DC on 18 March 1965; or</p>
        <p>(b) An ad hoc arbitral court of arbitration laid down under the Arbitration Rules of Procedure of the United Nations Commission for International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); or</p>
        <p>(c) The Court of Arbitration of the Paris International Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        <p>3. The arbitration awards shall be final and binding for all parties in the dispute. Each Party commits itself to execute the award according to its domestic law.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="VIII" title="Settlement of Disputes between the Parties">
        <p>1. The Parties shall seek in good faith and a spirit of cooperation a rapid and equitable solution to any dispute between them concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement. In this regard, the Parties agree to engage in direct and meaningful negotiations to arrive at such solutions. If the Parties cannot reach an agreement within six months after the beginning of disputes between themselves through the foregoing procedure, the disputes may be submitted, upon the request of either Party, to an arbitral tribunal of three members.</p>
        <p>2. Within two months of receipt of a request, each Party shall appoint an arbitrator. The two arbitrators shall select a third arbitrator as Chairman, who is a national of a third State. In the event either Party fails to appoint an arbitrator within the specified time, the other Party may request the President of the International Court of Justice to make the appointment.</p>
        <p>3. If both arbitrators cannot reach an agreement about the choice of the Chairman within two months after their appointment, the Chairman shall be appointed upon the request of either Party by the President of the International Court of Justice.</p>
        <p>4. If, in the cases specified under sub-articles (2) and (3), the President of the International Court of Justice is prevented from carrying out the said function or if he is a national of either Party, the appointment shall be made by the Vice-President, and if the Vice-President is prevented from carrying out the said function or if he is a national of either Party, the appointment shall be made by the most senior member of the Court who is not a national of either Party.</p>
        <p>5. The tribunal shall have three months from the date of the selection of the Chairman to agree upon rules of procedure consistent with the other provisions of this Agreement. In the absence of such agreement, the tribunal shall request the President of the International Court of Justice to designate rules of procedure, taking into account generally recognized rules of international arbitral procedure.</p>
        <p>6. Unless otherwise agreed, all submissions shall be made and all hearings shall be completed within eight months of the date of selection of the Chairman, and the tribunal shall render its decision within two months after the date of the final submissions or the date of the closing of the hearings, whichever is later. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decisions, which shall be final and binding, by a majority of votes.</p>
        <p>7. Expenses incurred by the Chairman, the other arbitrators, and other costs of the proceedings shall be paid for equally by the Parties. The tribunal may, however, at its discretion, decide that a higher proportion of the costs be paid by one of the Parties.</p>
        <p>8. A dispute shall not be submitted to an international arbitration court under the provisions of this Article, if the same dispute has been brought before another international arbitration court under the provisions of Article 7 and is still before the court. This will not impair the engagement in direct and meaningful negotiations between both Parties.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="IX" title="Entry Into Force">
        <p>1. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date on which the exchange of instruments of ratification has been completed. It shall remain in force for a period of ten years and shall continue in force unless terminated in accordance with sub-article 2. It shall apply to investments existing at the time of entry into force as well as to investments made or acquired thereafter.</p>
        <p>2. Either Party may, by giving one year's written notice to the other Party, terminate this Agreement at the end of the initial ten year period or at any time thereafter.</p>
        <p>3. This Agreement may be amended by written agreement between the Parties. Any amendment shall enter into force when each Party has notified the other that it has completed all internal requirements for entry into force of such amendment.</p>
        <p>4. With respect to investments made or acquired prior to the date of termination of this Agreement and to which this Agreement otherwise applies, the provisions of all of the other Articles of this Agreement shall thereafter continue to be effective for a further period of ten years from such date of termination.</p>
