        <p>A subsequent change of the form in which the investments have been made shall not affect their character as investments, provided that such a change does not contradict to the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investments have been made, as well as the relevant provisions of this Agreement. 2. The term "returns" means lawful amounts yielded by investments in particular, though not exclusively, includes profits, dividends, interest, royalties or other fees.</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion and protection of investment">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall promote and protect in its territory investments of investors of the other Contracting Party and admit such investments in accordance with its laws and regulations and accord them fair and equitable treatment and protection.</p>
        <p>2. In case of reinvestment of returns from an investment, these reinvestments and their returns shall enjoy the same protection as the initial investments.</p>
        <p>3. Each Contracting Party shall consider favourably, and in compliance with its laws and regulations, questions concerning entry, stay, work and movement in its territory of nationals of the other Contracting Party who carry out activities connected with the investments as defined in the present Agreement and of their families forming part of their household.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Treatment of investments">
        <p>1.

However, any new exceptions shall only apply to investments made after the entry into force of such exceptions.</p>
        <p>4. Should national legislation of the Contracting Parties or present or future international agreements applicable between the Contracting Parties contain regulations, whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by this Agreement, such regulation shall to the extent that is more favourable prevail over the present Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="Compensation for losses">
        <p>Investors of a Contracting Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Contracting Party owing to war, other armed conflict, state of national emergency or other similar events shall be accorded treatment, in respect to restitution, indemnification, compensation, or other settlement, no less favourable than that accorded to its own investors or to investors of any third State.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Expropriation">
        <p>1. Investments of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be expropriated, nationalised or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as "expropriation") in the territory of the other Contracting Party unless by due process of law, for public purpose, on a non-discriminatory basis and against prompt and adequate compensation.</p>
        <p>2. The compensation shall amount to the market value of the investments expropriated immediately before the date of expropriation or before the impending expropriation becomes public knowledge, whichever the earlier, and shall be paid without delay and shall carry interest at the rate applicable in the territory of that Contracting Party until the date of payment. The payment of such compensation shall be freely transferable in a freely usable currency.</p>
        <p>3. The investor affected shall have a right, under the law of the Contracting Party making the expropriation, to review, by a judicial or other independent authority of that Contracting Party, of his or its case and of the valuation of his or its investment in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 1 and 2. The Contracting Party making the expropriation shall make every endeavour to ensure that such review is carried out promptly.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Free transfer">

        <p>2. The transfers referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be made without delay, at the market exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transfer in the territory of the other Contracting Party where the investment was made.</p>
        <p>3. All transfers under this Article shall receive treatment no less favourable than that accorded to the transfers of an investment made by an investor of any third State.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Subrogation">
        <p>A Contracting Party having, by virtue of a guarantee covering noncommercial risk given for an investment made in the territory of the other Contracting Party, made payment to one of its own investors is, by virtue of subrogation, entitled to exercise the rights and actions as well as to assume the obligations of the said investor. The subrogation in the rights and obligations of the insured investor extends also to the right of transfer mentioned in Article 6. The paying Contracting Party cannot obtain rights or assume obligations greater than those of the insured investor.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Settlement of disputes between contracting parties">
        <p>1. Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall, as far as possible, be settled through negotiations between the Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>2. If a dispute between the Contracting Parties cannot thus be settled within six months after the beginning of negotiations, it shall upon the request of either Contracting Party be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>3. Such an arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way:</p>
        <p>Within three months from the receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the tribunal. Those two members shall then select a national of a third State who on approval by the two Contracting Parties shall be appointed Chairman of the tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two members. 4. If within the periods specified in paragraph 3 of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make any necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he also is prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision on the basis of the provisions of the present Agreement concluded between the Contracting Parties as well as the generally accepted principles and rules of international law. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be final and binding on both Contracting Parties. The tribunal determines its own procedure.</p>
        <p>6. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings. The cost of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties.</p>

        <p>1. In case of dispute with respect to investments between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party, consultation shall take place between the parties concerned with a view to solving the case amicably.</p>
        <p>2. If these consultations do not result in a solution within three months from the date of request for settlement, the investor may submit the dispute in respect to Articles 4, 5, 6 and 7, at his choice, for settlement to:</p>
        <p>(a) The competent courts of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment has been made; or</p>
        <p>(b) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes in case both Contracting Parties are Contracting States to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other state, opened for signature at Washington, D.C. on 18, 1965; or</p>
        <p>(c) An international ad hoc arbitral tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).</p>
        <p>Each Contracting Party shall give its consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration under subparagraphs b) or c) of this paragraph. 3. The arbitral tribunal established under this Article shall reach its decision on the basis of national laws and regulations of the Contracting Party, which is a party to the dispute, the provisions of the present Agreement, as well as applicable rules of international law.</p>
        <p>4. All arbitral awards shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute and shall be enforced in accordance with the laws of the Contracting Party to the dispute.</p>
        <p>5. All sums received or payable as a result of a settlement shall be freely transferable in a freely usable currency.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Consultation">
        <p>Each Contracting Party may propose to the other Contracting Party to enter into consultation concerning all questions related to the application or interpretation of the present Agreement. The other Contracting Party shall make the necessary steps for holding these consultations.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Applicability">
        <p>The provisions of this Agreement shall, from the date of entry into force thereof, also apply to investments that have been made in accordance with the respective legislation in force that date.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="12" title="Entry into force, duration and termination">
        <p>This Agreement shall enter into force on the thirtieth day after the date of the second of the notes by which the Contracting Parties inform each other that their constitutional requirements for the entry into force of this Agreement have been fulfilled. It shall remain in force for an initial period of ten years. It shall thereafter continue to be in force indefinitely, subject to the right of the Contracting Party to terminate it by twelve months' prior notice in writing to the other Contracting Party.
