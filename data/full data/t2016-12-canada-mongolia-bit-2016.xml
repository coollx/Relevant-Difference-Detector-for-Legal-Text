          <p>c.  transfer technology, a production process or other proprietary knowledge to a person in its territory except when the requirement is imposed or the commitment or undertaking is enforced by a court, administrative tribunal or competition authority to remedy an alleged violation of competition laws; and</p>
          <p>d.  supply exclusively from the territory of the Party the goods that such investment produces or the services it provides to a specific regional market or to the world market.</p>
          <p>3.  For greater certainty, paragraph 2 does not prevent a Party from conditioning the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with an investment in its territory, on compliance with a requirement set out in that paragraph.</p>
          <p>4.  A measure that requires an investment to use a technology to meet generally applicable health, safety or environmental requirements is not inconsistent with subparagraph 2(c).</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="10" title="Expropriation">
          <p>1.  Neither Party may nationalize or expropriate covered investments either directly or indirectly through measures having an effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as "expropriation"), except for a public purpose, in accordance with due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner and on prompt, adequate and effective compensation.</p>
          <p>2.  Such compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation took place ("date of expropriation"), and shall not reflect any change in value occurring because the intended expropriation had become known earlier. Valuation criteria shall include going concern value, asset value including declared tax value of tangible property, and other criteria to determine fair market value, as appropriate.</p>
          <p>3.  Compensation shall be paid without delay and shall be fully realizable and freely transferable.

          <p>5.  This Article shall not apply to the issuance of compulsory licenses granted in relation to intellectual property rights, or to the revocation, limitation or creation of intellectual property rights, to the extent that such issuance, revocation, limitation or creation is consistent with the WTO Agreement.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="11" title="Transfers">
          <p>1.  Each Party shall permit all transfers relating to covered investments to be made freely, and without delay, into and out of its territory. Such transfers include:</p>
          <p>a.  contributions to capital;</p>
          <p>b.  profits, dividends, interest, capital gains, royalty payments, management fees, technical assistance and other fees, returns in kind and other amounts derived from the covered investment;</p>
          <p>c.  proceeds from the sale of all or any part of covered investments or from the partial or complete liquidation of covered investments;</p>
          <p>d.  payments made under a contract entered into by the investor, or covered investments, including payments made pursuant to a loan agreement;</p>
          <p>e.  payments made pursuant to Articles 7 (Compensation for Losses) and 10 (Expropriation); and</p>
          <p>f.  payments arising under Section C (Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and the Host Party).</p>
          <p>2.  Each Party shall permit transfers relating to covered investments to be made in the convertible currency in which the capital was originally invested, or in any other convertible currency agreed to by the investor and the Party concerned. Unless otherwise agreed by the investor, transfers shall be made at the market rate of exchange applicable on the date of transfer.</p>
          <p>3.  Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, a Party may prevent a transfer through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of its laws relating to:</p>
          <p>a.  bankruptcy, insolvency or the protection of the rights of creditors;</p>
          <p>b.  issuing, trading or dealing in securities;</p>
          <p>c.  criminal or penal offences;</p>
          <p>d.  reports of transfers of currency or other monetary instruments; or</p>
          <p>e.  ensuring the satisfaction of judgments in adjudicatory proceedings.</p>
          <p>4.  Neither Party may require its investors to transfer, or penalize its investors for failing to transfer, the income, earnings, profits or other amounts derived from, or attributable to, investments in the territory of the other Party.</p>
          <p>5.  Paragraph 4 shall not be construed to prevent a Party from imposing any measure through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of its laws relating to the matters in subparagraphs (a) through (e) of paragraph 3.</p>
          <p>6.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 4, and without limiting the applicability of paragraph 5, a Party may prevent or limit transfers by a financial institution to, or for the benefit of, an affiliate of or person related to such institution, through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of measures relating to maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or financial responsibility of financial institutions.</p>
          <p>7.  Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a Party may restrict transfers of returns in kind in circumstances where it could otherwise restrict transfers under the WTO Agreement and as set out in paragraph 3.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="12" title="Transparency">
          <p>1.  Each Party shall ensure that its laws, regulations, procedures, and administrative rulings of general application respecting any matter covered by this Agreement are promptly published or otherwise made available in such a manner as to enable interested persons and the other Party to become acquainted with them.</p>
          <p>2.  To the extent possible, each Party shall:</p>
          <p>1.  publish in advance any such measure that it proposes to adopt; and</p>
          <p>2.  provide interested persons and the other Party a reasonable opportunity to comment on such proposed measures.</p>
          <p>3.  Upon request by a Party, information shall be exchanged on the measures of the other Party that may have an impact on covered investments.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="13" title="Subrogation">
          <p>1.  If a Party or any agency thereof makes a payment to any of its investors under a guarantee or a contract of insurance it has entered into in respect of an investment, the other Party shall recognize the validity of the subrogation in favour of the Party or agency to any right or title held by the investor.</p>
          <p>2.  A Party or any agency thereof, which is subrogated to the rights of an investor in accordance with paragraph 1, shall be entitled in all circumstances to the same rights as those of the investor in respect of the investment. Such rights may be exercised by the Party or any agency thereof, or by the investor if the Party or any agency thereof so authorizes.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="14" title="Corporate social responsibility">
          <p>Each Party should encourage enterprises operating within its territory or subject to its jurisdiction to voluntarily incorporate internationally recognized standards of corporate social responsibility in their practices and internal policies, such as statements of principle that have been endorsed or are supported by the Parties. These principles address issues such as labour, the environment, human rights, community relations and anti-corruption. The Parties should remind those enterprises of the importance of incorporating such corporate social responsibility standards in their internal policies.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="15" title="Health, safety and environmental measures">
          <p>The Parties recognize that it is inappropriate to encourage investment by relaxing domestic health, safety or environmental measures. Accordingly, a Party should not waive or otherwise derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from, such measures as an encouragement for the establishment, acquisition, expansion or retention in its territory of an investment of an investor. If a Party considers that the other Party has offered such an encouragement, it may request consultations with the other Party and the two Parties shall consult with a view to avoiding any such encouragement.</p>
        </div>

          <p>7.  Articles 6 (Minimum Standard of Treatment), 7 (Compensation for Losses), 8 (Senior Management, Boards of Directors and Entry of Personnel), 9 (Performance Requirements) and 11 (Transfers) shall not apply to taxation measures.</p>
          <p>8.  Articles 4 (National Treatment) and 5 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) shall not apply to:</p>

Any dispute between the Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall, whenever possible, be settled amicably through consultations.</p>
          <p>2.  If a dispute cannot be settled through consultations, it shall, at the request of either Party, be submitted to an arbitral panel for decision.</p>
          <p>3.  An arbitral panel shall be constituted for each dispute. Within two months after receipt through diplomatic channels of the request for arbitration, each Party shall appoint one member to the arbitral panel.

The Chair shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two members of the arbitral panel.</p>
          <p>4.  If within the periods specified in paragraph 3 the necessary appointments have not been made, either Party may invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Party or is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.

Where a Party determines that the dispute involves measures relating to financial institutions, or to investors or investments of such investors in financial institutions, or where a Party invokes paragraph 6 of Article 11 (Transfers), paragraphs 2 or 3 of Article 17 (General Exceptions), the arbitrators shall, in addition to the criteria set out in paragraph 5, have expertise or experience in financial services or practice, which may include the regulation of financial institutions.</p>
          <p>7.  The arbitral panel shall determine its own procedure. The arbitral panel shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be binding on both Parties. Unless otherwise agreed, the decision of the arbitral panel shall be rendered within six months of the appointment of the Chair.</p>
          <p>8.  Each Party shall bear the costs of its own member of the panel and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings. The costs related to the Chair and any remaining costs shall be borne equally by the Parties. The arbitral panel may, however, award that a higher proportion of costs be borne by one of the two Parties, and this award shall be binding on both Parties.</p>
          <p>9.  Within 60 days of the decision of a panel, the Parties shall reach agreement on the manner in which to resolve their dispute. Such agreement shall normally implement the decision of the panel.

    <attachments>
      <p>The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:</p>
      <p>1.  indirect expropriation results from a measure or series of measures of a Party that has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure;</p>
      <p>2.  the determination of whether a measure or series of measures of a Party constitutes an indirect expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:</p>
      <p>1.  the economic impact of the measure or series of measures, although the sole fact that a measure or series of measures of a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred;</p>
      <p>2.  the extent to which the measure or series of measures interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; and</p>
      <p>3.  the character of the measure or series of measures.</p>
      <p>3.  except in rare circumstances, such as when a measure or series of measures are so severe in the light of their purpose that they cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith, non-discriminatory measures of a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as health, safety and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriation.</p>
