        <p>2.

        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall, in its territory, accord to investments or returns of investors of the other Contracting Party fair and equitable treatment which shall be no less favorable than that which it accords to investments or returns of its own investors or to investment or returns of investors of any third State.</p>
        <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall, in its territory, accord to investors of the other Contracting Party, as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments, fair and equitable treatment which shall be no less favorable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State.</p>

        <p>"expropriation") in the territory of the other Contracting Party, except for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Contracting Party on a non-discriminatory basis and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, shall include interest from the date of expropriation until the date of payment, according to the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party where the expropriation takes place, shall be made without delay, be effectively realizable and be freely transferable. The investors affected shall have a right, under the law of the Contracting Party making the expropriation, to prompt review, by a judicial or other independent authority of that Contracting Party, of his or its case and of the valuation of his or its investment, in accordance with the principles set out in this paragraph. 2. Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company, which is incorporated or constituted under its laws and regulations, and in which investors of the other Contracting Party own shares or other forms of participation, the provisions of this Article shall be applied.</p>

      <div type="article" num="6" title="Repatriation of investments and returns">

        <p>f) Compensation pursuant to Article 4 and 5 of this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Disputes between a contracting party and an investor of the other contracting party">
        <p>1. Any dispute between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, including disputes concerning expropriation, shall, as far as possible, be settled by the parties to the dispute in an amicable way.</p>
        <p>2. The local remedies under the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made shall be available to the investor of the other Contracting Party on a basis no less favorable than that accorded to its own investors or investors of any third State.</p>
        <p>3. If the dispute cannot be settled within six(6) months from the date on which the dispute was raised by either party, it shall be submitted, upon request of either party, to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes(hereinafter referred to as the "Centre") for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Dispute between States and Nationals of Other States opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965.

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1.

        <p>2. If a dispute between the Contracting Parties cannot thus be settled within six(6) months from notification of the dispute, it shall, upon the request of either Contracting Party, be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>3.

        <p>4. If, within the periods specified in paragraph (3) of this Article, the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the Secretary-General of the Centre to make any necessary appointments.

If the Deputy Secretary-General is prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the Centre next in seniority shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be binding on both Contracting Parties. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings.

        <p>1. If one Contracting Party or its designated Agency(hereinafter referred to as the "First Contracting Party") makes a payment under an indemnity given in respect of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party (hereinafter referred to as the "Second Contracting Party"), the Second Contracting Party shall recognize:</p>
        <p>a) The assignment to the First Contracting Party by law or by legal transaction of all the rights and claims of the party indemnified; and</p>
        <p>b) That the First Contracting Party is entitled to exercise such rights and enforce such claims by virtue of subrogation, to the same extent as the party indemnified, and shall assume the obligations related to the investment.</p>
        <p>2. The First Contracting Party shall be entitled in all circumstances to:</p>
        <p>a) The same treatment in respect of the rights, claims and obligations acquired by it, by virtue of the assignment; and</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Application of other rules">
        <p>1. If the provisions of law of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement contain rules, whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favorable than is provided for by the present Agreement, such rules shall to the extent that they are more favorable prevail over the present Agreement.</p>
        <p>2. If the treatment to be accorded by one Contracting Party to investors of the other Contracting Party in accordance with its laws and regulations or other specific provisions or contracts is more favorable than that accorded by this Agreement, the more favorable treatment shall be accorded.</p>

        <p>The provisions of this Agreement shall apply to the rights and obligations of both Contracting Parties with respect to investments made on or before the entry into force of this Agreement.</p>

      <div type="article" num="12" title="Entry into force">
        <p>Each Contracting Party shall notify the other Contracting Party through the diplomatic channel of the completion of the ratification procedures required for bringing this Agreement into force. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the latter notification.</p>

    <attachments>
      <p>On signing the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Korea and the Government of the State of Israel for the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments, the undersigned have, in addition, agreed on the following provisions, which shall be regarded as an integral part of the said Agreement.</p>
      <p>AD. Article 6:</p>
      <p>Unrestricted transfer of investments and returns shall be guaranteed, provided that requirements and limitations as described below are respected. Such requirements and limitations shall not impair the free and undelayed transfer.</p>
      <p>a) Transfers shall be effected only after the investor has fulfilled all fiscal obligations of the Contracting Party where the investments were made and has complied with all the provisions of the exchange regulations.</p>
      <p>b) As of May 1998, the only limitation on foreign investments in Israel relates to transactions in derivatives made with the residents. The Government of Israel reserves the right to make amendments to the foreign exchange control regulations. However, it assures that changes in the regulations cannot adversely affect the rights of investors to repatriate investments and returns, once those investments have been made, and that the investors can only benefit from changes in the foreign exchange regulations.</p>
      <p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned, duly authorized thereto by their respective Governments, have signed this Protocol.</p>
      <p>Done in duplicate in the Korean, Hebrew and English languages, all texts being equally authentic, at Jerusalem this 7th day of February 1999, which corresponds to the 21st day of Shvat 5759 in the Jewish calendar. In the event of divergence in interpretation, the English text shall prevail.</p>
