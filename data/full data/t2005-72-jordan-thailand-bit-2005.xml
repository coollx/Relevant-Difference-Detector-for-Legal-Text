        <p>a) Natural persons who, according to the law of that Contracting Party, are considered to be its nationals;</p>

        <p>2.

        <p>2. The compensation shall amount to the market value of the investments expropriated immediately before the date of expropriation or before the impending expropriation becomes public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, and shall be paid without delay and shall carry interest at the rate applicable in the territory of that Contracting Party from the date the payment was due until the date of actual payment. The payment of such compensation shall be freely transferable in a freely usable currency.</p>
        <p>3.

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Subrogation">
        <p>1. If either Contracting Party or an agency designated by it makes payment to an investor under a policy of insurance against non-commercial risks, which it has given in respect of any investment or any part thereof in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall recognise:</p>
        <p>a) The assignment, whether under law or pursuant to a legal transaction, of any right or claim from such an investor to the former Contracting Party or its designated agency; and</p>

        <p>2. The former Contracting Party or its designated agency shall, accordingly, be entitled to assert, if it so desires, any such right or claim to the same extent as its predecessor in title.</p>
        <p>3.

        <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Settlement of disputes between investor and the contracting party">
        <p>1. In case of dispute with respect to investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, consultations shall take place between the parties concerned with a view to solving the case amicably.</p>
        <p>2. If these consultations do not result in a solution within six months from the date of request for settlement, the investor may submit the dispute, at the investor'schoice, for settlement to:</p>
        <p>a) The competent courts of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment has been made; or</p>

        <p>5. All sums received or payable as a result of a settlement shall be freely transferable in a freely usable currency.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="12" title="Settlement of disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1. Any dispute between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall, whenever possible, be settled amicably through consultations.</p>
        <p>2. If a dispute cannot be settled within six months through consultations, it shall, at the request of either Contracting Party, be submitted to an arbitral tribunal for decision.</p>
        <p>3. An arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each dispute. Within two months after receipt through diplomatic channels of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member to the arbitral tribunal. The two members shall then select a national of a third State who, upon approval by the two Contracting Parties, shall be appointed Chairman of the arbitral tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two members of the arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>4. If within the periods specified in paragraph 3 of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting party or is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or is prevented from discharging the said function, the Member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority, who is not a national of either contracting Party, shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5. The arbitral tribunal shall determine its own procedure. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be binding on both Contracting Parties. Unless otherwise agreed, the decision of the arbitral tribunal shall be rendered within six months of the appointment of the Chairman in accordance with paragraphs 3 or 4 of this Article.</p>
        <p>6. Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceeding; the costs related to the Chairman and any remaining costs shall be borne equally by the Contracting Parties. The arbitral tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the two Contracting Parties, and this award shall be binding on both Contracting Parties.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="13" title="Preservation of rights">
        <p>This Agreement shall in no way restrict the rights and benefits conferred to an investor of one Contracting Party by the provisions of national law of the other Contracting Party or on the basis of commitments made in international agreements which both Contracting Parties have entered into.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="14" title="Final provisions">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall notify the other in writing of the completion of the internal legal procedures required in its territory for the entry into force of this Agreement.

In respect of investments made prior to the date when the termination of this Agreement becomes effective, the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in force for a period of ten years.</p>
