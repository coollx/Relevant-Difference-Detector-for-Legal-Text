        <p>1- Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote as far as possible investments by investors of the other Contracting Party and admit such investments in accordance with its laws and regulations.</p>
        <p>2- When a Contracting Party shall have admitted an investment on its territory, it shall, in accordance with its laws and regulations, grant the necessary permits in connection with such an investment, including authorizations for engaging top managerial and technical personnel of their choice, regardless of nationality.</p>

        <p>4- With respect to the national treatment principle provided for by paragraph 2 of this Article it is understood that the treatment of Cuban State companies or other Cuban national entities may only be used as a comparative basis to the extent such entities operate as investors, i.e. as defined by the law at present applicable, as a party to a joint venture or an international economic association.</p>

Such compensation shall be equivalent to the value of the expropriated investment immediately before the date on which the actual or threatened expropriation, nationalization or comparable measure has become publicly known. The compensation shall be paid without delay and shall carry the usual bank interest until the time of payment; it shall be effectively realizable and freely transferable.
