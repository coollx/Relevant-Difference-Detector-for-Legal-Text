    </title>

      <p>THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY and THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA</p>

      <p>INTENDING to create favourable conditions for investments by nationals and companies of either State in the territory of the other State, and</p>

    <body>
      <div type="article" num="1">

It shall treat, in each case, these investments in a fair and equitable manner.</p>
        <p>(2) Investments by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall in the territory of the other Contracting Party not be subjected to treatment less favourable than that accorded to investments of its own nationals or companies or investments of nationals or companies of any third State on the ground that ownership or control of them is vested in nationals or companies of the former Contracting Party.</p>

      <p>PROTOCOL</p>
      <p>On signing the Treaty concerning the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments concluded between the Republic of Korea and the Federal Republic of Germany the undersigned plenipotentiaries have, in addition, agreed on the following provisions which should be regarded as an integral part of the present Treaty:</p>
      <p>(1) The Contracting Parties will within one year after signing the present Treaty enter into negotiations concerning the conclusion of an establishment treaty which should, inter alia, make provision for the following matters: entry and exit, temporary and permanent residence, protection from expulsion, the taking up and carrying on of business and professional activities, the foundation of, and participation in, enterprises without restriction as to capital; labour permits for managerial and technical staff, protection and security of persons and property, free access to courts, freedom to contract, acquisition of real estate and other property, admission as arbitrator.</p>
      <p>(2) Article 1</p>
      <p>a) Ad paragraph 1</p>
      <p>Investments made in accordance with the laws and regulations of a Contracting Party in its territory by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party shall enjoy the full protection of the present Treaty. To the extent that any admission procedures are required for making an investment, such investment shall enjoy this protection as from the date of the granting of the admission. Either Contracting Party may freely decide on this admission.</p>
      <p>b) Ad paragraph 2</p>
      <p>Paragraph 2 of Article 1 does not apply to more favourable treatment granted before the entry into force of the present Treaty. The Contracting Parties shall, however, apply their respective laws and regulations, in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 1, to any treatment granted after the entry into force of the present Treaty.</p>
      <p>(3) Ad Article 2</p>
      <p>a) The following shall in particular be deemed treatment less favourable as referred to in Article 2:</p>
      <p>Restricting the purchase of raw or auxiliary materials, of power or fuel, or of means of production or operation of any kind; impeding the marketing of products inside or outside the country, as well as any other measures having similar effects. Measures taken for reasons of public security and order, public health or morality shall not be deemed treatment less favourable within the meaning of Article 2.</p>
      <p>b) In the interest of its national economy either Contracting Party may, in admitting an investment by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, make specific stipulations deviating from the treatment provided for in Article 2. If specific stipulations of that nature have been made the provisions of Article 2 shall, to that extent, not be applicable. Such specific stipulations to be effective, shall be made in detail in the document of admission.</p>
      <p>c) Article 2 shall not apply to entry, sojourn, and activity as an employee.</p>
      <p>(4) Ad Article 3 paragraph 2</p>
      <p>Expropriation shall be deemed to be any kind of deprivation by acts of sovereign power of any asset or right which constitutes an investment or is a part thereof, as well as other acts of sovereign power which are tantamount to expropriation, and also measures of nationalization.</p>
      <p>(5) Ad Article 4</p>
      <p>a) A)In deviation from Article 4 either Contracting Party may in the document of admission or, if no such document of admission is required, in a written understanding reached before the assets are invested, reserve the right to subject nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to restrictions of transfer. Either Contracting Party shall apply such restrictions only to the extent required in specific cases by its balance of payments. In any event, the following minimum transfers shall, however, be guaranteed:</p>
      <p>a) Transfer of capital remitted to the territory of either Contracting Party for purposes of an investment but not yet invested, in full;</p>
      <p>b) Transfer of returns to the extent of annually twenty per cent of the value of the investment as at the date of the transfer;</p>
      <p>c) Transfer, in the event of liquidation, of annually twenty per cent of the liquidation proceeds. Where an admission for an investment is required this stipulation shall not be applicable until two years after the date of such admission.</p>
      <p>To the extent that the amounts referred to under b and c above have not been transferred within one year, additional transfer of the untransferred amounts in the years following thereafter shall be guaranteed by the Contracting Parties.</p>
      <p>b) The term "liquidation" within the meaning of Article 4 shall be deemed to include any disposal effected for the purpose of complately or partly giving up the investment concerned.</p>
      <p>(6) Ad Article 5 paragraph 1</p>
      <p>Subrogation in Article 5 means such subrogation as is effected by virtue of law or of legal transaction.</p>
      <p>(7) Ad Article 6 paragraph 1</p>
      <p>A transfer shall be deemed to have been made "without undue delay" within the meaning of paragraph 1 of Article 6 if made within such period as is normally required for the completion of transfer formalities. The said period shall commence on the day on which the relevant request has been submitted and may on no account exceed two months.</p>
      <p>(8) Ad Article 8 paragraph 1</p>
      <p>Either Contracting Party may, in individual cases, lay down in the document of admission the amount of capital intended to be invested in its territory and any determine the form in which such capital shall be invested. Either Contracting Party may examine whether the assests so invested correspond in form and value to those referred to in the document of admission. When conspicuous differences arise as to the result of the examination the Contracting Parties may appoint a group of experts to reconsider the examination.</p>
      <p>(9) Ad Article 11</p>
      <p>Article 11 does not exclude that both Contracting Parties agree in an individual case to invoke the International Court of Justice to decide a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the present Treaty in lieu of the procedure provided for in Article 11.</p>
      <p>(10) Either Contracting Party shall refrain from any discriminatory measures which, contrary to the principles of free competition, are designed to prevent or hinder carriers of the other Contracting Party from participating in the transport of goods that represent an investment within the meaning of the present Treaty. This also applies to goods acquired in the territory of either Contracting Party or of any third State by means of the capital invested in the territory of the Contracting Party concerned within the meaning of the present Treaty.</p>
      <p>(11) Without prejudice to any other method of determining nationality, any person shall in particular be deemed to be a national of a Contracting Party who is in possession of a national passport issued by the appropriate authorities of the Contracting Party concerned.</p>
      <p>DONE at Seoul on February 4th, 1964 in six originals, two in the Korean, two in German and two in the English languages, each text being equally authentic. In the event of a divergence between any of the texts of this Treaty, the English text shall prevail.</p>
