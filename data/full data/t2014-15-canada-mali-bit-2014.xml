        <div type="article" num="10" title="Expropriation">
          <p>1.  A Party shall not nationalize or expropriate a covered investment either directly or indirectly through measures having an effect equivalent to</p>
          <p>Nationalization or expropriation ("expropriation") except for a public purpose, in accordance with due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner and on payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation. For greater certainty, this paragraph is interpreted in accordance with Annex B.</p>
          <p>10.</p>
          <p>2.  This compensation referred to in paragraph 1 must be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation took place ("date of expropriation"), and must not reflect a change in value occurring because the intended expropriation had become known earlier. Valuation criteria must include going concern value, asset value including declared tax value of tangible property, and other criteria, as appropriate, to determine fair market value.</p>
          <p>3.  Compensation shall be paid without delay and shall be fully realizable and freely transferable. Compensation shall be payable in a freely convertible currency and shall include interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that currency from the date of expropriation until date of payment.</p>

          <p>5.  This Article does not apply to the issuance of compulsory licenses granted in relation to intellectual property rights, or to the revocation, limitation, or creation of intellectual property rights, to the extent that the issuance, revocation, limitation, or creation is consistent with the WTO Agreement.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="11" title="Transfer">
          <p>1.  Each Party shall permit all transfers relating to a covered investment to be made freely and without delay, into and out of its territory. Those transfers include:</p>
          <p>(a)  contributions to capital;</p>
          <p>(b)  profits, dividends, interest, capital gains, royalty payments, management fees, technical assistance and other fees, returns in kind and other amounts derived from the covered investment;</p>
          <p>(c)  proceeds from the sale of all or any part of the covered investment or from the partial or complete liquidation of the covered investment;</p>
          <p>(d)  payments made under a contract entered into by the investor, or the covered investment, including payments made pursuant to a loan agreement;</p>
          <p>(e)  payments made pursuant to Articles 7 (Compensation for Losses) and 10 (Expropriation); and</p>
          <p>(f)  payments arising under Section C (Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and the Host Party).</p>
          <p>2.  Each Party shall permit transfers relating to a covered investment to be made in the convertible currency in which the capital was originally invested, or in any other convertible currency agreed to by the investor and the Party concerned. Unless otherwise agreed by the investor, transfers shall be made at the market rate of exchange in effect on the date of transfer.</p>
          <p>3.  Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, a Party may prevent a transfer through the equitable, non-discriminatory, and good faith application of its domestic law relating to:</p>
          <p>(a)  bankruptcy, insolvency, or the protection of the rights of creditors;</p>
          <p>(b)  issuing, trading or dealing in securities;</p>
          <p>(c)  criminal or penal offences;</p>
          <p>(d)  reports of transfers of currency or other monetary instruments; or</p>
          <p>(e)  enforcement of orders or judgements in judicial or similar proceedings.</p>
          <p>4.  A Party may not require its investors to transfer, or penalize its investors for failing to transfer, the income, earnings, profits, or other amounts derived from, or attributable to, investments in the territory of the other Party.</p>
          <p>5.  Paragraph 4 does not prevent a Party from imposing a measure through the equitable, non-discriminatory, and good faith application of its domestic law relating to the matters in subparagraphs 3(a) through 3(e).</p>
          <p>6.  Notwithstanding paragraphs 1, 2 and 4, and without limiting the applicability of paragraph 5, a Party may prevent or restrict transfers by a financial institution to, or for the benefit of, an affiliate of or person related to that institution, through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of measures relating to maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or financial responsibility of financial institutions.</p>
          <p>7.  Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a Party may restrict transfers of returns-in-kind in circumstances where it could otherwise restrict transfers under the WTO Agreement, and as set out in paragraph 3.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="12" title="Transparency">
          <p>1.  Each Party shall ensure that its laws, regulations, procedures, and administrative rulings of general application respecting any matter covered by this Agreement are promptly published or otherwise made available in such a manner as to enable interested persons and the other Party to become acquainted with them.</p>
          <p>2.  To the extent possible, each Party shall:</p>
          <p>(a)  publish in advance any such measure that it proposes to adopt; and</p>
          <p>(b)  provide interested persons and the other Party a reasonable opportunity to comment on that measure.</p>
          <p>3.  Upon request by a Party, information is exchanged on any of the measures of the other Party that may have an impact on covered investments.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="13" title="Subrogation">
          <p>1.  If a Party or any agency of a Party makes a payment to any of its investors under a guarantee or a contract of insurance it has entered into in respect of an investment, the other Party shall recognize the validity of the subrogation in favour of the Party or agency to any right or title held by the investor.</p>
          <p>2.  A Party or any agency of a Party that is subrogated to the rights of an investor in accordance with paragraph 1 is entitled, in all circumstances, to the same rights as the investor in respect of the investment. Those rights may be exercised by the Party or any agency of the Party or by the investor if the Party or its agency authorizes it.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="14" title="Taxation measures">
          <p>1.  Except as set out in this Article, the provisions of this Agreement do not apply to taxation measures.</p>
          <p>2.  The provisions of this Agreement do not affect the rights and obligations of the Parties under a tax convention. In the event of an inconsistency between this Agreement and a tax convention, the tax convention applies to the extent of the inconsistency.</p>
          <p>3.  The provisions of this Agreement do not require a Party to furnish or allow access to information that, if disclosed, would be contrary to the Party's law protecting information concerning the taxation affairs of a taxpayer.</p>
          <p>4.  Subject to paragraph 2, the provisions of Articles 4 (National Treatment) and 5 (Most Favoured Nation Treatment) apply to all taxation measures, other than those that relate to income, capital gains, or the taxable capital of corporations. However, the provisions of these Articles do not apply to:</p>
          <p>(a)  a non-conforming provision of any existing taxation measure;</p>
          <p>(b)  the continuation or prompt renewal of a non-conforming provision of any existing taxation measure;</p>
          <p>(c)  an amendment to a non-conforming provision of any existing taxation measure to the extent that the amendment does not decrease its conformity at the time of the amendment with those Articles; or</p>
          <p>(d)  any new taxation measure that is aimed at ensuring the equitable and effective imposition or collection of taxes (including, for greater certainty, any measure that is taken by a Party to ensure compliance with the Party's taxation system or to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes)</p>
          <p>And that does not arbitrarily discriminate between persons, goods or services of the Parties.</p>
          <p>5.  If the conditions in paragraph 6 are met:</p>
          <p>(a)  a claim by an investor that a taxation measure of a Party is in breach of an agreement between a central government authority of a Party and the investor concerning an investment is considered a claim for breach of this Agreement; and</p>
          <p>(b)  the provisions of Article 10 (Expropriation) apply to taxation measures.</p>
          <p>6.  An investor may not make a claim under paragraph 5 unless:</p>
          <p>(a)  the investor provides a copy of the notice of claim to the taxation authorities of the Parties; and</p>
          <p>(b)  six months after receiving notification of the claim by the investor, the taxation authorities of the Parties fail to reach a joint determination that, in the case of subparagraph 5(a), the measure does not contravene that agreement, or in the case of subparagraph 5(b), the measure in question is not an expropriation.</p>
          <p>7.  If, in connection with a claim by an investor of a Party or a dispute between the Parties, an issue arises as to whether a measure of a Party is a taxation measure, a Party may refer the issue to the taxation authorities of the Parties. A decision of the taxation authorities shall bind any Tribunal formed pursuant to Section C (Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and the Host Party) or arbitral panel formed pursuant to Section D (State-to-State Dispute Settlement Procedures). A Tribunal or arbitral panel seized of a claim or a dispute in which the issue arises may not proceed until it receives the decision of the taxation authorities.

          <p>1.  A Party may request consultations on the interpretation or application of this Agreement. The other Party shall give sympathetic consideration to the request. Any dispute between the Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall, whenever possible, be settled amicably through consultations.</p>
          <p>2.  If a dispute cannot be settled through consultations, it shall, at the request of a Party, be submitted to an arbitral panel for decision.</p>
          <p>3.  An arbitral panel shall be constituted for each dispute. Within two months after receipt through diplomatic channels of the request for arbitration, each Party shall appoint one member to the arbitral panel. The two members shall then select a national of a third State who, upon approval by the two Parties, shall be appointed Chair of the arbitral panel. The Chair shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two members of the arbitral panel.</p>
          <p>4.  If within the periods specified in paragraph 3 the necessary appointments have not been made, a Party may invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President is a national of a Party or is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of a Party or is prevented from discharging the said function, the Member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority, who is not a national of either Party, shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
          <p>5.  Arbitrators shall have expertise or experience in public international law, international trade or international investment rules, or the resolution of disputes arising under international trade or international investment agreements.

          <p>6.  Where a Party determines that the dispute involves measures relating to financial institutions, or to investors or investments of such investors in financial institutions, or where the respondent Party invokes Article 11(6) (Transfers), 17(2), or 17(3) (General Exceptions), the arbitrators shall, in addition to the criteria set out in paragraph 5, have expertise or experience in financial services law or practice, which may include the regulation of financial institutions.</p>
          <p>7.  The arbitral panel shall determine its own procedure. The arbitral panel shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. The decision is binding on both Parties. Unless otherwise agreed, the decision of the arbitral panel shall be rendered within six months of the appointment of the Chair pursuant to paragraph 3 or 4.</p>
          <p>8.  Each Party shall bear the costs of its own member of the panel and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings. The costs related to the Chair and any remaining costs shall be borne equally by the Parties. The arbitral panel may, however, award that a higher proportion of costs be borne by one of the two Parties, and this award shall be binding on both Parties.</p>
          <p>9.  Within 60 days of the decision of an arbitral panel, the Parties shall reach agreement on the manner in which to resolve their dispute. The agreement normally implements the decision of the arbitral panel. If the Parties fail to reach agreement, the Party bringing the dispute shall be entitled to compensation or to suspend benefits of equivalent value to those awarded by the panel.</p>

      <p>In Witness Whereof the undersigned, duly authorized, have signed this Agreement.</p>

      <p>Annex B.10</p>
      <p>Expropriation</p>
      <p>The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:</p>
      <p>a)  indirect expropriation results from a measure or series of measures of a Party that have an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure;</p>
      <p>b)  the determination of whether a measure or series of measures of a Party constitute an indirect expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:</p>
      <p>O i) the economic impact of the measure or series of measures, although the sole fact that a measure or series of measures of a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred;</p>
      <p>O ii) the extent to which the measure or series of measures interfere with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; and o iii) the character of the measure or series of measures;</p>
      <p>c)  except in rare circumstances, such as when a measure or series of measures are so severe in the light of their purpose that they cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith, non-discriminatory measures of a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as health, safety and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriation.</p>
