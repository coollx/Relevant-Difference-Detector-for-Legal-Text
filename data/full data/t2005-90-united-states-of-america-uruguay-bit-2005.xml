        <p>3. For greater certainty, this Treaty does not bind either Party in relation to any act or fact that took place or any situation that ceased to exist before the date of entry into force of this Treaty.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="National treatment">
        <p>1.

        <p>2. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments in its territory of its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.</p>
        <p>3. The treatment to be accorded by a Party under paragraphs 1 and 2 means, with respect to a regional level of government, treatment no less favorable than the treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that regional level of government to natural persons resident in and enterprises constituted under the laws of other regional levels of government of the Party of which it forms a part, and to their respective investments.</p>

If the disputing parties fail to reach agreement, the tribunal shall determine the place in accordance with the applicable arbitral rules, provided that the place shall be in the territory of a State that is a party to the New York Convention.</p>
        <p>2. The non-disputing Party may make oral and written submissions to the tribunal regarding the interpretation of this Treaty.</p>
        <p>3. The tribunal shall have the authority to accept and consider amicus curiae submissions from a person or entity that is not a disputing party.</p>
        <p>4. Without prejudice to a tribunal's authority to address other objections as a preliminary question, a tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made under Article 34.</p>
        <p>(a) Such objection shall be submitted to the tribunal as soon as possible after the tribunal is constituted, and in no event later than the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its counter-memorial (or, in the case of an amendment to the notice of arbitration, the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its response to the amendment).</p>
        <p>(b) On receipt of an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits, establish a schedule for considering the objection consistent with any schedule it has established for considering any other preliminary question, and issue a decision or award on the objection, stating the grounds therefor.</p>
        <p>(c) In deciding an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall assume to be true claimant's factual allegations in support of any claim in the notice of arbitration (or any amendment thereof) and, in disputes brought under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the statement of claim referred to in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The tribunal may also consider any relevant facts not in dispute.</p>
        <p>(d) The respondent does not waive any objection as to competence or any argument on the merits merely because the respondent did or did not raise an objection under this paragraph or make use of the expedited procedure set out in paragraph 5.</p>
        <p>5. In the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days after the tribunal is constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection under paragraph 4 and any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal's competence. The tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits and issue a decision or award on the objection(s), stating the grounds therefor, no later than 150 days after the date of the request. However, if a disputing party requests a hearing, the tribunal may take an additional 30 days to issue the decision or award. Regardless of whether a hearing is requested, a tribunal may, on a showing of extraordinary cause, delay issuing its decision or award by an additional brief period, which may not exceed 30 days.</p>
        <p>6. When it decides a respondent's objection under paragraph 4 or 5, the tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney's fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection. In determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant's claim or the respondent's objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment.</p>
        <p>7. A respondent may not assert as a defense, counterclaim, right of set-off, or for any other reason that the claimant has received or will receive indemnification or other compensation for all or part of the alleged damages pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract.</p>
        <p>8. A tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to ensure that the tribunal's jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the tribunal's jurisdiction. A tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of a measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 24. For purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a recommendation.</p>
        <p>9.</p>
        <p>(a) In any arbitration conducted under this Section, at the request of a disputing party, a tribunal shall, before issuing a decision or award on liability, transmit its proposed decision or award to the disputing parties and to the non-disputing Party. Within 60 days after the tribunal transmits its proposed decision or award, the disputing parties may submit written comments to the tribunal concerning any aspect of its proposed decision or award. The tribunal shall consider any such comments and issue its decision or award not later than 45 days after the expiration of the 60-day comment period.</p>
        <p>(b) Subparagraph (a) shall not apply in any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Section for which an appeal has been made available pursuant to paragraph 10 or Annex E.</p>
        <p>10. If a separate multilateral agreement enters into force between the Parties that establishes an appellate body for purposes of reviewing awards rendered by tribunals constituted pursuant to international trade or investment arrangements to hear investment disputes, the Parties shall strive to reach an agreement that would have such appellate body review awards rendered under Article 34 in arbitrations commenced after the multilateral agreement enters into force between the Parties.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="29" title="Transparency of arbitral proceedings">
        <p>1. Subject to paragraphs 2 and 4, the respondent shall, after receiving the following documents, promptly transmit them to the non-disputing Party and make them available to the public:</p>
        <p>(a) The notice of intent;</p>
        <p>(b) The notice of arbitration;</p>
        <p>(c) Pleadings, memorials, and briefs submitted to the tribunal by a disputing party and any written submissions submitted pursuant to Article 28(2) and (3) and Article 33;</p>
        <p>(d) Minutes or transcripts of hearings of the tribunal, where available; and</p>
        <p>(e) Orders, awards, and decisions of the tribunal.</p>
        <p>2. The tribunal shall conduct hearings open to the public and shall determine, in consultation with the disputing parties, the appropriate logistical arrangements. However, any disputing party that intends to use information designated as protected information in a hearing shall so advise the tribunal. The tribunal shall make appropriate arrangements to protect the information from disclosure.</p>
        <p>3. Nothing in this Section requires a respondent to disclose protected information or to furnish or allow access to information that it may withhold in accordance with Article 18 or Article 19.</p>
        <p>4. Any protected information that is submitted to the tribunal shall be protected from disclosure in accordance with the following procedures:</p>
        <p>(a) Subject to subparagraph (d), neither the disputing parties nor the tribunal shall disclose to the non-disputing Party or to the public any protected information where the disputing party that provided the information clearly designates it in accordance with subparagraph (b);</p>
        <p>(b) Any disputing party claiming that certain information constitutes protected information shall clearly designate the information at the time it is submitted to the tribunal;</p>
        <p>(c) A disputing party shall, at the time it submits a document containing information claimed to be protected information, submit a redacted version of the document that does not contain the information. Only the redacted version shall be provided to the non-disputing Party and made public in accordance with paragraph 1; and</p>
        <p>(d) The tribunal shall decide any objection regarding the designation of information claimed to be protected information. If the tribunal determines that such information was not properly designated, the disputing party that submitted the information may (i) withdraw all or part of its submission containing such information, or (ii) agree to resubmit complete and redacted documents with corrected designations in accordance with the tribunal's determination and subparagraph (c). In either case, the other disputing party shall, whenever necessary, resubmit complete and redacted documents which either remove the information withdrawn under (i) by the disputing party that first submitted the information or redesignate the information consistent with the designation under (ii) of the disputing party that first submitted the information.</p>
        <p>5. Nothing in this Section requires a respondent to withhold from the public information required to be disclosed by its laws.</p>

      <div type="article" num="30" title="Governing law">
        <p>1. Subject to paragraph 3, when a claim is submitted under Article 24(1)(a)(i)(A) or Article 24(1)(b)(i)(A), the tribunal shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules of international law.</p>
        <p>2. Subject to paragraph 3 and the other terms of this Section, when a claim is submitted under Article 24(1)(a)(i)(B) or (C), or Article 24(1)(b)(i)(B) or (C), the tribunal shall apply:</p>
        <p>(a) The rules of law specified in the pertinent investment authorization or investment agreement, or as the disputing parties may otherwise agree; or</p>
        <p>(b) If the rules of law have not been specified or otherwise agreed:</p>
        <p>(i) The law of the respondent, including its rules on the conflict of laws;(20) and</p>
        <p>(ii) Such rules of international law as may be applicable.</p>
        <p>3. A joint decision of the Parties, each acting through its representative designated for purposes of this Article, declaring their interpretation of a provision of this Treaty shall be binding on a tribunal, and any decision or award issued by a tribunal must be consistent with that joint decision.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="31" title="Interpretation of annexes">
        <p>1. Where a respondent asserts as a defense that the measure alleged to be a breach is within the scope of an entry set out in Annex I, II, or III, the tribunal shall, on request of the respondent, request the interpretation of the Parties on the issue. The Parties shall submit in writing any joint decision declaring their interpretation to the tribunal within 60 days of delivery of the request.</p>
        <p>2. A joint decision issued under paragraph 1 by the Parties, each acting through its representative designated for purposes of this Article, shall be binding on the tribunal, and any decision or award issued by the tribunal must be consistent with that joint decision. If the Parties fail to issue such a decision within 60 days, the tribunal shall decide the issue.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="32" title="Expert reports">
        <p>Without prejudice to the appointment of other kinds of experts where authorized by the applicable arbitration rules, a tribunal, at the request of a disputing party or, unless the disputing parties disapprove, on its own initiative, may appoint one or more experts to report to it in writing on any factual issue concerning environmental, health, safety, or other scientific matters raised by a disputing party in a proceeding, subject to such terms and conditions as the disputing parties may agree.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="33" title="Consolidation">
        <p>1. Where two or more claims have been submitted separately to arbitration under Article 24(1) and the claims have a question of law or fact in common and arise out of the same events or circumstances, any disputing party may seek a consolidation order in accordance with the agreement of all the disputing parties sought to be covered by the order or the terms of paragraphs 2 through 10.</p>
        <p>2. A disputing party that seeks a consolidation order under this Article shall deliver, in writing, a request to the Secretary-General and to all the disputing parties sought to be covered by the order and shall specify in the request:</p>
        <p>(a) The names and addresses of all the disputing parties sought to be covered by the order;</p>
        <p>(b) The nature of the order sought; and</p>
        <p>(c) The grounds on which the order is sought.</p>
        <p>3. Unless the Secretary-General finds within 30 days after receiving a request under paragraph 2 that the request is manifestly unfounded, a tribunal shall be established under this Article.</p>
        <p>4. Unless all the disputing parties sought to be covered by the order otherwise agree, a tribunal established under this Article shall comprise three arbitrators:</p>
        <p>(a) One arbitrator appointed by agreement of the claimants;</p>
        <p>(b) One arbitrator appointed by the respondent; and</p>
        <p>(c) The presiding arbitrator appointed by the Chairman, provided, however, that the presiding arbitrator shall not be a national of either Party.</p>
        <p>5. If, within 60 days after the Secretary-General receives a request made under paragraph 2, the respondent fails or the claimants fail to appoint an arbitrator in accordance with paragraph 4, the Chairman, on the request of any disputing party sought to be covered by the order, shall appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed. If the respondent fails to appoint an arbitrator, the Chairman shall appoint a national of the disputing Party, and if the claimants fail to appoint an arbitrator, the Chairman shall appoint a national of the non-disputing Party.</p>
        <p>6. Where a tribunal established under this Article is satisfied that two or more claims that have been submitted to arbitration under Article 24(1) have a question of law or fact in common, and arise out of the same events or circumstances, the tribunal may, in the interest of fair and efficient resolution of the claims, and after hearing the disputing parties, by order:</p>
        <p>(a) Assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine together, all or part of the claims;</p>
        <p>(b) Assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine one or more of the claims, the determination of which it believes would assist in the resolution of the others; or</p>
        <p>(c) Instruct a tribunal previously established under Article 27 to assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine together, all or part of the claims, provided that</p>
        <p>(i) That tribunal, at the request of any claimant not previously a disputing party before that tribunal, shall be reconstituted with its original members, except that the arbitrator for the claimants shall be appointed pursuant to paragraphs 4(a) and 5; and</p>
        <p>(ii) That tribunal shall decide whether any prior hearing shall be repeated.</p>
        <p>7. Where a tribunal has been established under this Article, a claimant that has submitted a claim to arbitration under Article 24(1) and that has not been named in a request made under paragraph 2 may make a written request to the tribunal that it be included in any order made under paragraph 6, and shall specify in the request:</p>
        <p>(a) The name and address of the claimant;</p>
        <p>(b) The nature of the order sought; and</p>
        <p>(c) The grounds on which the order is sought.</p>
        <p>The claimant shall deliver a copy of its request to the Secretary-General.</p>
        <p>8. A tribunal established under this Article shall conduct its proceedings in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, except as modified by this Section.</p>
        <p>9. A tribunal established under Article 27 shall not have jurisdiction to decide a claim, or a part of a claim, over which a tribunal established or instructed under this Article has assumed jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>10. On application of a disputing party, a tribunal established under this Article, pending its decision under paragraph 6, may order that the proceedings of a tribunal established under Article 27 be stayed, unless the latter tribunal has already adjourned its proceedings.</p>

      <div type="article" num="34" title="Awards">
        <p>1. Where a tribunal makes a final award against a respondent, the tribunal may award, separately or in combination, only:</p>
        <p>(a) Monetary damages and any applicable interest; and</p>
        <p>(b) Restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide that the respondent may pay monetary damages and any applicable interest in lieu of restitution.</p>
        <p>A tribunal may also award costs and attorney's fees in accordance with this Treaty and the applicable arbitration rules.</p>
        <p>2. Subject to paragraph 1, where a claim is submitted to arbitration under Article 24(1)(b):</p>
        <p>(a) An award of restitution of property shall provide that restitution be made to the enterprise;</p>
        <p>(b) An award of monetary damages and any applicable interest shall provide that the sum be paid to the enterprise; and</p>
        <p>(c) The award shall provide that it is made without prejudice to any right that any person may have in the relief under applicable domestic law.</p>
        <p>3. A tribunal may not award punitive damages.</p>
        <p>4. An award made by a tribunal shall have no binding force except between the disputing parties and in respect of the particular case.</p>
        <p>5. Subject to paragraph 6 and the applicable review procedure for an interim award, a disputing party shall abide by and comply with an award without delay.</p>
        <p>6. A disputing party may not seek enforcement of a final award until:</p>
        <p>(a) In the case of a final award made under the ICSID Convention,</p>
        <p>(i) 120 days have elapsed from the date the award was rendered and no disputing party has requested revision or annulment of the award; or</p>
        <p>(ii) Revision or annulment proceedings have been completed; and</p>
        <p>(b) In the case of a final award under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, or the rules selected pursuant to Article 24(3)(d),</p>
        <p>(i) 90 days have elapsed from the date the award was rendered and no disputing party has commenced a proceeding to revise, set aside, or annul the award; or</p>
        <p>(ii) A court has dismissed or allowed an application to revise, set aside, or annul the award and there is no further appeal.</p>
        <p>7. Each Party shall provide for the enforcement of an award in its territory.</p>
        <p>8. If the respondent fails to abide by or comply with a final award, on delivery of a request by the non-disputing Party, a tribunal shall be established under Article 37. Without prejudice to other remedies available under applicable rules of international law, the requesting Party may seek in such proceedings:</p>
        <p>(a) A determination that the failure to abide by or comply with the final award is inconsistent with the obligations of this Treaty; and</p>
        <p>(b) A recommendation that the respondent abide by or comply with the final award.</p>
        <p>9. A disputing party may seek enforcement of an arbitration award under the ICSID Convention, the New York Convention, or the Inter-American Convention regardless of whether proceedings have been taken under paragraph 8.</p>
        <p>10. A claim that is submitted to arbitration under this Section shall be considered to arise out of a commercial relationship or transaction for purposes of Article I of the New York Convention and Article I of the Inter-American Convention.</p>

      <p>Customary International Law</p>
      <p>The Parties confirm their shared understanding that "customary international law" generally and as specifically referenced in Article 5 and Annex B results from a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation. With regard to Article 5, the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens refers to all customary international law principles that protect the economic rights and interests of aliens.</p>

      <p>Expropriation</p>
      <p>The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:</p>
      <p>1. Article 6(1) is intended to reflect customary international law concerning the obligation of States with respect to expropriation.</p>
      <p>2. An action or a series of actions by a Party cannot constitute an expropriation unless it interferes with a tangible or intangible property right or property interest in an investment.</p>
      <p>3. Article 6(1) addresses two situations. The first is known as direct expropriation, where an investment is nationalized or otherwise directly expropriated through formal transfer of title or outright seizure.</p>
      <p>4. The second situation addressed by Article 6(1) is known as indirect expropriation, where an action or series of actions by a Party has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.</p>
      <p>(a) The determination of whether an action or series of actions by a Party, in a specific fact situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation, requires a case-bycase, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:</p>
      <p>(i) The economic impact of the government action, although the fact that an action or series of actions by a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred;</p>
      <p>(ii) The extent to which the government action interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; and</p>
      <p>(iii) The character of the government action.</p>
      <p>(b) Except in rare circumstances, non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health, safety, and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriations.</p>

      <p>Submission of a Claim To Arbitration</p>
      <p>1. An investor of the United States may not submit to arbitration under Section B a claim that Uruguay has breached an obligation under Articles 3 through 10 either:</p>
      <p>(a) On its own behalf under Article 24(1)(a), or</p>
      <p>(b) On behalf of an enterprise of Uruguay that is a juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly under Article 24(1)(b),</p>
      <p>If the investor or the enterprise, respectively, has alleged that breach of an obligation under Articles 3 through 10 in proceedings before a court or administrative tribunal of Uruguay.</p>
      <p>2. For greater certainty, if an investor of the United States elects to submit a claim of the type described in paragraph 1 to a court or administrative tribunal of Uruguay, that election shall be definitive, and the investor may not thereafter submit the claim to arbitration under Section B.</p>

      <p>Financial Services</p>
      <p>1. In the application of Article 3 to measures relating to financial institutions, the Parties share the understanding that the treatment that each Party owes under that Article:</p>
      <p>(a) To investors of the other Party, means treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own investors, in like circumstances, with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of financial institutions and investments in financial institutions in its territory; and</p>
      <p>(b) To financial institutions of the other Party and to investments of investors of the other Party in financial institutions, means treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own financial institutions, and to investments of its own investors in financial institutions, in like circumstances, with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of financial institutions and investments.</p>
      <p>2. In the application of Article 4 to measures relating to financial institutions, the Parties share the understanding that the treatment that each Party owes under that Article to investors of the other Party, financial institutions of the other Party, and investments of investors of the other Party in financial institutions means treatment no less favorable than that it accords to investors, financial institutions, and investments of investors in financial institutions of a non-Party, in like circumstances, with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of financial institutions and investments.</p>
      <p>3. For purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, "financial institution of the other Party" means a financial institution, including a branch, located in the territory of a Party that is controlled by persons of the other Party.</p>
      <p>4. No claim that a measure relating to an investor of a Party, or a covered investment, in a financial institution located in the territory of the other Party breaches Article 3 or Article 4 may be submitted to arbitration under Section B. For purposes of this paragraph:</p>
      <p>(a) The term "financial institution" means any financial intermediary or other enterprise that is authorized to do business and regulated or supervised as a financial institution under the law of the Party in whose territory it is located.</p>
      <p>(b) Investment means "investment" as defined in Article 1, except that, with respect to "loans" and "debt instruments" referred to in that Article:</p>
      <p>(i) A loan to or debt instrument issued by a financial institution is an investment in a financial institution only where it is treated as regulatory capital by the Party in whose territory the financial institution is located; and</p>
      <p>(ii) A loan granted by or debt instrument owned by a financial institution, other than a loan to or debt instrument of a financial institution referred to in subparagraph (b)(i), is not an investment in a financial institution.</p>
      <p>5. For greater certainty, nothing in this Treaty shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by a Party of measures relating to investors of the other Party, or covered investments, in financial institutions that are necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations that are not inconsistent with this Treaty, including those relating to the prevention of deceptive and fraudulent practices or that deal with the effects of a default on financial services contracts, subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where like conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on investment in financial institutions.</p>

      <p>Sovereign Debt Restructuring</p>
      <p>1. No claim that a restructuring of a debt instrument issued by Uruguay breaches an obligation under Articles 5 through 10 may be submitted to, or if already submitted continue in, arbitration under Section B, if the restructuring is a negotiated restructuring at the time of submission, or becomes a negotiated restructuring after such submission.</p>
      <p>2.</p>
      <p>(a) For purposes of this Annex, "negotiated restructuring" means the restructuring or rescheduling of a debt instrument that has been effected through:</p>
      <p>(i) A modification of the key payment terms of such debt instrument, as provided for under the terms of such debt instrument; or</p>
      <p>(ii) A debt exchange or other process in which the holders of no less than the percentage of debt specified in subparagraph (b) have consented to such debt exchange or other process.</p>
      <p>(b) The percentage referred to in subparagraph (a)(ii) shall be the percentage required to modify the key payment terms of a single series of bonds in the most recent widely-distributed issue of external sovereign bonds that:</p>
      <p>(i) Were issued by Uruguay prior to the alleged breach;</p>
      <p>(ii) Are governed by New York law; and</p>
      <p>(iii) Permit the modification of the key payment terms by holders of less than 100 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the debt outstanding.</p>
      <p>3. Notwithstanding Article 24(3) and subject to paragraph 1 of this Annex, an investor of the United States may not submit a claim under Section B that a restructuring of debt issued by Uruguay breaches an obligation under Articles 5 through 10 unless 270 days have elapsed from the date of the events giving rise to the claim.</p>

      <p>1. The Parties note that the definition of "state enterprise" in Article 1 is not intended to expand the meaning of empresa p&#xFA;blica as that term is used in the domestic law of Uruguay. Under such law, an empresa p&#xFA;blica must be owned or controlled by the State and regulated by domestic public law.</p>
      <p>2. The Parties confirm their shared understanding that, consistent with general principles of law applicable to international arbitration, when a claimant submits a claim to arbitration under Section B, it has the burden of proving all elements of its claim, including the damages that it alleges were sustained by reason of, or arising out of, the alleged breach. Accordingly, the Parties further share the understanding that, where a claimant has met its burden of proving that the respondent has breached an obligation under Section A with respect to an attempt to make an investment, the only damages that may be awarded are those that the claimant has proven were sustained in the attempt to make the investment, provided that the claimant also proves that the breach was the proximate cause of those damages.</p>
      <p>3. For greater certainty, the Parties confirm that the list of "legitimate public welfare objectives" in paragraph 4(b) of Annex B on Expropriation is not exhaustive.</p>
      <p>4. Uruguay has provided the following descriptive and explanatory information solely for purposes of transparency. Under its domestic law, Uruguay conditions investment in certain sectors on the prior issuance or granting of a concession or authorization by the Government of Uruguay. Such concessions or authorizations are granted by the Government of Uruguay on the basis of "legality, opportunity, convenience, or merit" under Uruguayan law, and are also subject to Uruguay's investment law, Law No. 16.906, which forbids discrimination on the basis of nationality.</p>

      <p>(1) Some forms of debt, such as bonds, debentures, and long-term notes, are more likely to have the characteristics of an investment, while other forms of debt, such as a bank account that does not have a commercial purpose and is related neither to an investment in the territory in which the bank account is located nor to an attempt to make such an investment, are less likely to have such characteristics</p>
      <p>(2) For purposes of this Treaty, claims to payment that are immediately due and result from the sale of goods or services are not investments.</p>
      <p>(3) Whether a particular type of license, authorization, permit, or similar instrument (including a concession, to the extent that it has the nature of such an instrument) has the characteristics of an investment depends on such factors as the nature and extent of the rights that the holder has under the law of the Party. Among the licenses, authorizations, permits, and similar instruments that do not have the characteristics of an investment are those that do not create any rights protected under domestic law. For greater certainty, the foregoing is without prejudice to whether any asset associated with the license, authorization, permit, or similar instrument has the characteristics of an investment.</p>
      <p>(4) The term "investment" does not include an order or judgment entered in a judicial or administrative action.</p>
      <p>(5) "Written agreement" refers to an agreement in writing, executed by both parties, whether in a single instrument or in multiple instruments, that creates an exchange of rights and obligations, binding on both parties under the law applicable under Article 30(2). For greater certainty, (a) a unilateral act of an administrative or judicial authority, such as a permit, license, or authorization issued by a Party solely in its regulatory capacity, or a decree, order, or judgment, standing alone; and (b) an administrative or judicial consent decree or order, shall not be considered a written agreement.</p>
      <p>(6) For purposes of this definition, "national authority" means an authority at the central level of government.</p>
      <p>(7) For greater certainty, actions taken by a Party to enforce laws of general application, such as competition laws, are not encompassed within this definition.</p>
      <p>(8) For greater certainty, "TRIPS Agreement" includes any waiver in force between the Parties of any provision of the TRIPS Agreement granted by WTO Members in accordance with the WTO Agreement.</p>
      <p>(9) Article 5 shall be interpreted in accordance with Annex A.</p>
      <p>(10) Article 6 shall be interpreted in accordance with Annexes A and B.</p>
      <p>(11) For greater certainty, a condition for the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage referred to in paragraph 2 does not constitute a "commitment or undertaking" for the purposes of paragraph 1.</p>
      <p>(12) The Parties recognize that a patent does not necessarily confer market power.</p>
      <p>(13) For the United States, "laws" for purposes of this Article means an act of the United States Congress or regulations promulgated pursuant to an act of the United States Congress that is enforceable by action of the central level of government.</p>
      <p>(14) For the United States, "statutes or regulations" for purposes of this Article means an act of the United States Congress or regulations promulgated pursuant to an act of the United States Congress that is enforceable by action of the central level of government.</p>

      <p>(17) It is understood that the term "monetary authority of a Party" includes the finance ministry of a Party, or its equivalent, where that ministry has responsibilities with respect to monetary and related credit or exchange rate policies.</p>
      <p>(18) For purposes of this Article, "competent financial authorities" means, for the United States, the Department of the Treasury for banking and other financial services, and the Office of the United States Trade Representative, in coordination with the Department of Commerce and other agencies, for insurance; and for Uruguay, the Ministerio de Econom&#xED;a y Finanzas, in coordination with the Banco Central del Uruguay.</p>
      <p>(19) For the purposes of this Article, the "competent tax authorities" means:</p>
      <p>(a) For the United States, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury (Tax Policy), Department of the Treasury; and</p>
      <p>(b) For Uruguay, the Director, Direcci&#xF3;n General Impositiva del Ministerio de Econom&#xED;a y Finanzas.</p>
      <p>(20) The "law of the respondent" means the law that a domestic court or tribunal of proper jurisdiction would apply in the same case.</p>
