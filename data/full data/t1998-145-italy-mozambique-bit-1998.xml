        <p>4 . Each Contracting Party shall create and maintain, in its territory a legal framework apt to guarantee to investors the continuity of legal treatment, including the compliance, in good faith, of all undertakings assumed with regard to each specific investor.</p>

        <p>The exchange rate applicable to any such compensation shall be that prevailing on the date immediately prior to the moment in which the nationalisation or expropriation has been announced or made public.</p>
        <p>Without restricting the scope of the present Article, in case that the object of one of the measures referred to in paragraph 2 of this article is a legal person jointly created by Italian and Mozambican investors, the evaluation of the share of the investors will be, in the currency of the investment, not lower than the starting value, increased proportionally by capital increases and revaluation of capital, undistributed profits and reserve funds, and diminished proportionally by the value of the losses.</p>
        <p>4 . Compensation will be considered as actual if it will have been paid in the same currency in which the investment was made.</p>
        <p>5 . Compensation will be considered as timely if it takes place without undue delay and, in any case, within one month.</p>
        <p>6 . Compensation shall include interests calculated on six months LIBOR basis from the date of nationalisation or expropriation to the date of payment.</p>
