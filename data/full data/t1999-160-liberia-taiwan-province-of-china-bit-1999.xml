        <p>The parties to the dispute may agree in writing to modify the rules applicable to the arbitration. The award shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute. Each party undertakes to enforce the awards.</p>

        <p>(1) Disputes between the Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall, if possible, be amicably settled through consultation.</p>

Those two members shall then select a national of a third State who on approval by the Parties shall be appointed Chairman of the tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>(4) If within the periods specified in paragraph (3) of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, either Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the Chairman of the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce to make any necessary appointments. If the Chairman is a national of either Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-Chairman shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.

        <p>(5) The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Each Party shall bear the costs of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings; the costs of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Parties. The tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of these costs shall be borne by one of the two Parties. The tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>

        <p>(2) Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of investors of the other Party.</p>
