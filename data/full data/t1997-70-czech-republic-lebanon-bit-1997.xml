    </conclusion>
    <attachments>
      <p>Lebanon has exceptional ties with Arab countries, which are now or shall become members of the Arab League. Consequently, the Lebanese Government has extended special privilege s to the nationals of these countries. These privileges are either reciprocal or non-reciprocal.</p>
      <p>One of these privileges, is the ownership, without prior approval of the Council of Ministers, of real estate property up to 5000 m2 in Lebanon. This privilege dates back to 1969 by the law number 11614 of January 4, 1969. Due to the above, Lebanon cannot but grant such privileges to nationals of Arab countries.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that non-Arab nationals, whether physical persons or legal entities, could own real estate in Lebanon provided they acquire prior approval from the Council of Ministers.</p>
