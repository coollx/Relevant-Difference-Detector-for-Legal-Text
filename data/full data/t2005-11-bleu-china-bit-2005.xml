      <p>(b) The continuation of any such non-conforming measure;</p>
      <p>(c) Any amendment to any such non-conforming measure to the extent that the amendment does not increase the non-conformity of these measures. The People's Republic of China will take all appropriate steps in order to progressively remove the non-conforming measures.</p>

      <p>It's mutually understood that the People's Republic of China requires that the investor concerned exhausts the domestic administrative review procedure specified by the laws and regulations of the People's Republic of China, before submission of the dispute to international arbitration under Article 8, paragraph 2. The People's Republic of China declares that such a procedure will take a maximum period of three months.</p>
