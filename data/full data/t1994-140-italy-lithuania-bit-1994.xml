        <p>Compensation shall be paid without undue delay and shall be freely transferable.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Nationalization or expropriation">

Investments of investors of one of the Contracting Parties shall not be, "de jure" or "de facto", directly or indirectly, nationalized, expropriated, requisitioned or subjected to any measures having an equivalent effect in the territory of the other Contracting Party, except for public purposes or national interest and in exchange for immediate, full and effective compensation, and on condition that these measures are taken on a non-discriminatory basis and in conformity with all legal provisions, procedures and orders handed down by Courts or Tribunals having jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>2. The just compensation shall be established on the basis of international market values immediately prior to the moment on which the decision to nationalize or expropriate is announced or made public.</p>
        <p>Where that value cannot be readily ascertained, the compensation shall be determined in accordance with general recognized principles of evaluation taking into account the capital invested, depreciation, capital already repatriated, replacement value, currency exchange rate movements and other relevant factor.</p>
        <p>The exchange rate applicable to any such compensation shall be that prevailing on the date immediately prior to the moment in which the nationalization or expropriation has been announced or made public.</p>
        <p>3. Without restricting the scope of the above paragraph, in case that the object of nationalisation, expropriation, or similar, is a company with foreign capital, the evaluation of the share of the investor will be, in the currency of the investment not lower than the starting value, increased by capital increases and revaluation of capital, undistributed profits and reserve funds, and diminished by the value of capital reductions and losses.</p>
        <p>4. Compensation will be considered as actual if it will have been paid in the same currency in which the investment has been made by the foreign investor, in as much as such currency is &#x2014; or remains &#x2014; convertible, or, otherwise, in any other currency accepted by the investor.</p>
        <p>5. Compensation will be considered as timely if it takes place without undue delay.</p>
        <p>6. Compensation shall include interests calculated on the basis of LIBOR standards referring to the period comprised between the date of nationalisation or expropriation and the date of payment.</p>
        <p>7. A national or company of either Contracting Party that asserts that all or part of its investment has been expropriated shall have a right to prompt review by the appropriate judicial or administrative authorities of the other Contracting Party to determine whether any such expropriation has occurred and, if so, whether such expropriation, and any compensation thereof, conforms to the principles of international law, and to decide all other matters relating thereto.</p>
        <p>8. In the absence of an understanding between the investor and the responsible authority, the amount of compensation will be established according to the procedures for dispute resolution as per Article 9 of this Agreement. Compensation will be freely transferable.</p>
        <p>9. The provisions of paragraph 1. of this Article shall also apply to profits accruing to an investment and, in the event of winding-up, the proceeds of liquidation.</p>
        <p>10. If, after the dispossession, the good concerned has not been utilized, wholly or partially, for that purpose, the owner or his assignees are entitled to the repurchasing of the good at the market price.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Repatriation of capital, profits and income">
        <p>1. Each of the Contracting Parties shall guarantee that the investors of the other Contracting Party may transfer abroad, without undue delay, in any convertible currency, the following:</p>
        <p>a) Capital and additional capital, including reinvested income, used to maintain and increase investment;</p>
        <p>b) The net income, dividends, royalties, payments for assistance and technical services, interests and other profits;</p>

        <p>2. Without restricting the scope of Article 3 of this Agreement, the Contracting Parties undertake to apply to the transfers mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article the same favourable treatment that is accorded to investments effected by investors of Third States, in case it is more favourable.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Subrogation">
        <p>In the event that one Contracting Party or an Institution thereof has provided a guarantee in respect of non-commercial risks for the investment effected by one of its investors in the territory of the other Contracting Party, and has effected payment to the said investor on the basis of that guarantee, the other Contracting Party shall recognise the assignment of the rights of the investor to the first-named Contracting Party. In relation to the transfer of payments to the Contracting Party or its Institution by virtue of this assignment, the provisions of Article 4, 5 and 6 of this Agreement shall apply.</p>
      </div>

      <div type="article" num="9" title="Settlement of disputes between investors and contracting parties">
        <p>1. Any dispute which may arise between one of the Contracting Parties and the investors of the other Contracting Party on investments, including disputes relating to the amount of compensation, shall be settled amicably, as far as possible.</p>
        <p>2. In case the investor and one entity of one of the Contracting Parties have stipulated an investment agreement, the procedure foreseen in such investment agreement shall apply.</p>
        <p>3. In the event that such dispute cannot be settled amicably within six months of the date of the written application for settlement, the investor in question may submit at his choice the dispute for settlement to:</p>

        <p>1. Any dispute which may arise between the Contracting Parties relating to the interpretation and application of this Agreement shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably through diplomatic channels.</p>
        <p>2.

        <p>3. The Arbitration Tribunal shall be constituted in the following manner: within two months from the moment on which the request for arbitration is received, each of the two Contracting Parties shall appoint a member of the Tribunal. The appointed arbitrators shall select the President of the Arbitration Tribunal who is a national of a third State. The President shall be appointed within three months of the date on which the other two members are appointed.</p>
        <p>4. If within the period specified in paragraph 3. of this Article, the appointments have not been made, each of the two Contracting Parties can, in default of other arrangements, ask the President of the International Court of Justice to make the appointment.

        <p>2. Whenever the treatment accorded by one Contracting Party to the investors of the other Contracting Party, according to its laws and regulations or other provisions or a specific contract or an investment agreement, is more favourable than that provided under this agreement, the most favourable treatment shall apply.</p>
        <p>3. Whenever, after the date when the investment has been made, a modification should take place in the legislation of the Party on whose territory the investment has been carried out, acquired rights of the investor under previous legislation will not be affected.</p>
