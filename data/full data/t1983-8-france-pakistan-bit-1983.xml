        <p>1. With respect to article 3: </p>
        <p>a) We shall consider as de jure or de facto impediments to fair and equitable treatment any discriminatory restriction on the purchase or transport of raw materials and auxiliary materials, energy and fuels, as well as the means of production and operation of all types, any discriminatory hindrance of the sale or transport of products within the country and abroad, as well as any other measures that have a similar effect. </p>
