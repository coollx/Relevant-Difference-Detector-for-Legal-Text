      </div>
      <div type="article" num="12" title="Subrogation">
        <p>1. In the event that either Contracting Party (or any agency, institution, statutory body or corporation designated by it) as a result of an indemnity it has given in respect of an investment or any part thereof makes payment to its own nationals and companies in respect of any of their claims under this Agreement, the other Contracting Party acknowledges that the former Contracting Party (or any agency, institution, statutory body or corporation designated by it) is entitled by virtue of subrogation to exercise the rights and assert the claims of its own nationals and companies. The subrogated right or claim shall not be greater than the original right or claim of the said investor.</p>
        <p>2. Any payment made by one Contracting Party (or any agency, institution, statutory body or corporation designated by it) to its nationals and companies shall not affect the right of such nationals and companies to make their claims against the other Contracting Party in accordance with Article 13.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="13" title="Investment disputes">
        <p>1.

        <p>2. If the dispute cannot be thus resolved as provided in paragraph (1) of this Article within 6 months from the date of notice given thereunder, then the Contracting Party and the investor concerned shall refer the dispute to either conciliation in accordance with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Rules of Conciliation 1980 or to arbitration in accordance with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Rules on Arbitration, 1976 subject to the following provisions:</p>

        <p>b) In respect of arbitration proceedings, the following shall apply:</p>
        <p>i) The Arbitral Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators. Each party shall select an arbitrator. These two arbitrators shall appoint by mutual agreement a Chairman who shall be a national of a third State which has diplomatic relations with the Governments of the parties to the dispute. The arbitrators shall be appointed within two months from the date when one of the parties to the dispute inform the other of its intention to submit the dispute to arbitration after the lapse of the six months mentioned in paragraph (2) of this Article.</p>
        <p>ii) The Arbitral Award shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the relevant domestic laws including the rules on the conflict of laws of the territory of the Contracting Party in which the investment dispute arises as well as the generally recognized principles of international law.</p>
        <p>iii) If the necessary appointments are not made within the period specified in paragraph (2) (b) (i), either party may, in the absence of any other agreement, request the Secretary-General of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes to make the necessary appointments.</p>

        <p>vii) Each party concerned shall bear the cost of its own arbitrator and its representation in the arbitral proceedings. The cost of the Chairman in discharging his arbitral function and the remaining costs of the tribunal shall be borne equally by the parties concerned. The tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borned by one of the two parties, and this award shall be binding on both parties.</p>
        <p>3. As an alternative to arbitration in accordance with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Rules on Arbitration, 1976, the parties may opt to have the arbitration conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre.</p>
        <p>4. The conciliation or arbitration shall, as far as possible, be held in Singapore.</p>
        <p>5 . The provisions of this Article shall not prejudice the Contracting Parties from using the procedures specified in Article 14 where a dispute concerns the interpretation or application of this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="14" title="Disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1. Any dispute between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall, as far as possible, be settled through negotiation.</p>
        <p>2. If any dispute cannot be settled, it shall upon the request of either Contracting Party be submitted to arbitration. The arbitral tribunal (hereinafter called &#x201E;the tribunal") shall consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by each Contracting Party and the third, who shall be Chairman of the tribunal, appointed by agreement of the Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>3. Within two months of receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one arbitrator, and within two months of such appointment of the two arbitrators, the Contracting Parties shall appoint the third arbitrator.</p>
        <p>4 . If the tribunal shall not have been constituted within four months of receipt of the request for arbitration, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is unable to do so, the Vice-President may be invited to do so. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is unable to do so, the Member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party may be invited to make the necessary appointments, and so on.</p>
        <p>5. The tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes.</p>
        <p>6. The tribunal's decision shall be final and the Contracting Parties shall abide by and comply with the terms of its award.</p>
        <p>7. Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitration proceedings and half the costs of the Chairman and the remaining costs. The tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the two Parties, and this award shall be binding on both Parties.</p>
        <p>8. Apart from the above the tribunal shall establish its own rules of procedure.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="15" title="Other obligations">
        <p>If the legislation of either Contracting Party or international obligations existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to this Agreement, result in a position entitling investments by nationals of the other Contracting Party to treatment more favourable than is provided for by this Agreement, such position shall not be affected by this Agreement. Each Contracting Party shall observe any commitment in accordance with its laws additional to those specified in this Agreement entered into by the Contracting Party, its nationals or companies with nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party as regards their investments.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="16" title="Entry into force, duration and termination">

This Agreement shall remain in force for a period of fifteen years and shall continue in force thereafter unless, after the expiry of the initial period of fourteen years, either Contracting Party notifies in writing the other Contracting Party of its intention to terminate this Agreement.
