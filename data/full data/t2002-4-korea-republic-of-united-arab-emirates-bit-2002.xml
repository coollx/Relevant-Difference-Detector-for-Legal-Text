        <p>3. Investors of each Contracting Party may apply to the competent authorities in the other Contracting Party for the appropriate facilities, incentives and other forms of encouragement and the latter Contracting Party may grant them all assistance, consents, approvals, licenses and conditions as may be determined by its laws and regulations.</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Treatment of investments">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investments and returns of investors of the other Contracting Party, treatment no less favourable than that which it accords to investments and returns of its own investors or to investments and returns of investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to investors.</p>
        <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investors of the other Contracting Party as regards operation, management, maintenance, use, and enjoyment of disposal of their investments, treatment no less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to investors.</p>
        <p>3. The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to investors of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment or preference of privilege resulting from any international agreement or arrangement relating wholly or mainly to taxation.</p>
        <p>4. Such treatment shall not relate to privileges which either Contracting Party accords to investors of third States on account of its present or future membership of, or association with a customs or economic union, a common market or a free trade area or similar international agreements.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="Compensation for losses">
        <p>1. Investors of one Contracting Party whose investments suffer losses owing to war or other armed conflict, a state of national emergency, revolt, insurrection, riot or other similar events in the territory of the other Contracting Party, shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party, treatment as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other forms of settlement, no less favourable than that which the latter Contracting Party accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State. Resulting payments shall be freely transferable without undue delay.</p>
        <p>2. Without prejudice to paragraph (1) of this Article, investors of one Contracting Party who, in any of the events referred to in that paragraph, suffer losses in the territory of the other Contracting Party resulting from:</p>
        <p>(a) Requisitioning of their property by its forces or authorities; or</p>
        <p>(b) Destruction of their property by its forces or authorities which was not caused in combat action or was not required by the necessity of the situation,</p>
        <p>Shall be accorded restitution or adequate compensation no less favourable than that which would be accorded under the same circumstances to investors of that other Contracting Party or to an investor of any other State. Resulting payments shall be freely transferable without undue delay.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Expropriation">
        <p>1. Investments of investors of one Contracting Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated or otherwise subject to any other measures such as sequestration or confiscation having an effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as "expropriation") in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for public purpose and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. The expropriation shall be carried out on a non-discriminatory basis in accordance with legal procedures. Without prejudice to provisions of this paragraph, when a decision is made to expropriate the claims to money whose amount is being disputed in the legal procedure, that amount may be deemed not to have been expropriated until the final settlement is made.</p>
        <p>2. Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the expropriated investments immediately before expropriation was taken or before impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, shall include interest at the applicable commercial rate from the date of expropriation until the date of payment and shall be made without undue delay, be effectively realizable and be freely convertible and transferable. Where the fair market value cannot be readily ascertained, the compensation shall be determined on equitable principles taking into account, inter alia, depreciation of the capital invested, capital already repatriated, replacement value, goodwill and other relevant factors.</p>
        <p>3. Investors of one Contracting Party affected by expropriation shall have a right to prompt review by a judicial or other independent authority of the other Contracting Party, of their case and of the valuation of their investments in accordance with the principles set out in this Article.</p>
        <p>4. Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is incorporated or constituted under its laws and regulations, and in which investors of the other Contracting Party own shares, debentures or other forms of participation, the provisions of this Article shall be applied.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Transfers">
        <p>1. Each Contracting party shall guarantee to investors of the other Contracting Party the free transfer of their investments and returns. Such transfers shall include, in particular, though not exclusively:</p>
        <p>(a) Net profit, capital gains, dividends, interest, royalties, fees and any other current income accruing from investments;</p>
        <p>(b) Proceeds accruing from the sale or the total or partial liquidation of investments;</p>
        <p>(c) Funds in repayment of loans related to investments;</p>
        <p>(d) Earnings of nationals of the other Contracting Party who are allowed to work in connection with investments in its territory;</p>
        <p>(e) Additional funds necessary for the maintenance or development of the existing investments; and</p>
        <p>(f) Compensation pursuant to Articles 4 and 5.</p>
        <p>2. All transfers under this Agreement shall be made in a freely convertible currency, without delay or restriction, at the market exchange rate, prevailing at the date of the transfer.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If a Contracting Party or its authorized agency makes a payment to its own investors under an indemnity given in respect of investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall recognize:</p>
        <p>(a) The assignment, whether under the law or pursuant to a legal transaction in that State, of any rights or claims from investors to the former Contracting Party or its authorized agency; and</p>
        <p>(b) That the former Contracting Party or its authorized agency is entitled by virtue of subrogation to exercise the rights of and enforce the claims of those investors.</p>
        <p>(c) Questions regarding subrogation shall be consulted in the Joint Committee set by Article 8 of this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Consultation">
        <p>The Contracting Parties shall establish a Joint Committee where both Contracting Parties or their designated agencies will consult matters in connection with this Agreement in order to effectively implement this Agreement and to prevent disputes related to investments.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Settlement of investment disputes between a contracting party and an investor of the other contracting party">
        <p>1. Any dispute between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party including expropriation or nationalization of investments shall, as far as possible, be settled by the parties of the dispute in an amicable way.</p>
        <p>2. The local remedies under the laws and regulations of one Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment has been made shall be available for investors of the other Contracting Party on the basis of treatment no less favourable than that accorded to investments of its own investors or investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to investors.</p>
        <p>3. If the dispute cannot be settled within six (6) months from the date on which the dispute has been raised by either party, the disputing Contracting Party shall agree to submit the dispute to the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter referred to as ICSID) established by the ICSID Convention.</p>

        <p>1. Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be settled by consultation through diplomatic channels.</p>

        <p>3. Such an Arbitral Tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way; Within two (2) months from the date of receipt of the written request of either party for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the Tribunal.

The Chairman shall be appointed within two (2) months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>4.

If the president is a national of either Contracting Party or otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the appointments. If the Vice-President also is a national of either Contracting Party or prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority, who is not a national of either Contracting Party, shall be invited to make the appointments.</p>
        <p>5. The Arbitral Tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be binding on both Contracting Parties.</p>

If the treatment to be accorded by one Contracting Party to investors of the other Contracting Party in accordance with its laws and regulations or other specific provisions or contracts is more favourable than that accorded by this Agreement, the more favourable treatment shall be accorded.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="12" title="Application of the agreement">
