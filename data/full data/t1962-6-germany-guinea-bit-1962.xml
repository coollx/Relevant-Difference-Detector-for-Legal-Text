      <p>Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Guinea on the Promotion of Capital Investments</p>
    </title>
    <preamble>
      <p>THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY AND THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA</p>
      <p>DESIRING to deepen economic cooperation between the two countries,</p>
      <p>INCURRING to create favorable conditions for the investments of nationals and companies of one State in the territory of the other State,</p>
      <p>RECOGNIZING that the promotion and the contractual protection of these investments are likely to stimulate private economic initiatives and increase the prosperity of the two peoples,</p>
      <p>HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
    </preamble>
    <body>
      <div type="article" num="1">
        <p>Each Contracting Party shall encourage by appropriate means the investment of capital in its territory by nationals and companies of the other Contracting Party, shall admit such investments in accordance with its legislation and shall give sympathetic consideration to the granting of the necessary authorizations. It shall treat such investments, in each case, in a fair and equitable manner.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2">
        <p>No Contracting Party shall subject nationals and companies of the other Contracting Party, in its territory, in respect of investments owned by them or subject to their influence, in respect of the professional and economic activity which they carry on in connection with such investments, and in respect of the administration, enjoyment and use of such investments, to conditions less favourable than those to which its own nationals and companies or the nationals and companies of third States are subject.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3">
        <p>(1) Investments of nationals and companies of a Contracting Party shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>(2) The nationals and companies of a Contracting Party may not be expropriated from their investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for reasons of public utility and in return for compensation. The compensation shall correspond to the value of the investment at the time of expropriation, shall be effectively realizable, freely transferable and shall be paid without delay. At the time of expropriation, at the latest, the compensation and the method of payment shall be determined. The legality of the expropriation and the amount of the compensation shall be subject to verification by ordinary judicial proceedings.</p>
        <p>(3) Nationals and companies of a Contracting Party whose investments have been damaged by an armed conflict, revolution or riot in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall be treated by the other Contracting Party with respect to restitution, indemnity, compensation or other damages in a manner not less favourable than that accorded to the nationals and companies of that Party. With respect to the transfer of such payments, the Contracting Parties undertake mutually to accord to the nationals and companies of the other Contracting Party treatment no less favorable than that accorded in similar cases to the nationals and companies of a third State.</p>
        <p>(4) The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 above shall also apply to the proceeds of investments.</p>
        <p>(5) With regard to matters governed by this Article, nationals and companies of a Contracting Party shall enjoy in the territory of the other Contracting Party most-favoured-nation treatment.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4">
        <p>Each Contracting Party shall guarantee to the nationals and companies of the other Contracting Party the transfer of the capital invested and the proceeds of such capital and, in the event of liquidation, the proceeds of the liquidation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5">
        <p>If a Contracting Party, by virtue of a guarantee given for an investment, makes payments to one of its nationals or to one of its companies, the other Contracting Party, without prejudice to the rights of the first Contracting Party under Article 10, shall recognize the transfer by operation of law or by contract of all the rights and claims of that national or company to the first Contracting Party and the subrogation in its favour of all such rights and claims. As regards the transfer of payments to be made to the Contracting Party by virtue of the transfer of rights, the provisions of Article 3(2), (3) and (4) and of Article 4 shall apply mutatis mutandis.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6">
        <p>(1) Insofar as the parties concerned have not concluded an arrangement to the contrary with the approval of the competent authorities of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is located, transfers under Article 3(2), (3) and (4), Article 4 or Article 5 shall be effected without delay and at the rate of exchange applicable on the date of the transfer for current transactions.</p>
        <p>(2) The rate applicable to current transactions shall be based on the par value agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund and shall not exceed the margin of fluctuation permitted under Article IV, Section 3 of the Agreement on the International Monetary Fund on either side of the parity.</p>
        <p>(3) If, for one of the Contracting Parties, there is no exchange rate within the meaning of paragraph 2 on the date of the transfer, the official rate fixed by that Contracting Party for its national currency in relation to the U.S. dollar or another freely convertible currency or to gold shall apply. If no such rate is fixed either, the competent authorities of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is situated shall accept a fair and equitable exchange rate.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7">
        <p>If the legal provisions of one of the Contracting Parties or international obligations, now existing or to be established in the future between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Treaty, provide for a regulation which accords to investments of nationals and companies of the other Contracting Party a more favorable treatment than that provided for in the present Treaty, the latter shall not affect the regulation in question. Each Contracting Party shall comply with any other commitments relating to investments by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to which it has subscribed.</p>

        <p>(3) Ad Article 2</p>
        <p>(a) Each Contracting Party may, in the interest of its national economy, when admitting an investment made by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, agree with such nationals or companies in the act of admission to special conditions regarding</p>
        <p>(a) the administration of the investment</p>

This provision shall also apply if the carriage is performed in the territory of a Contracting Party or between it and a third State on behalf of an enterprise in which capital has been invested within the meaning of this Treaty.</p>
