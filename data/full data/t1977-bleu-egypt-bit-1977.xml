      <p>Desiring to reinforce economic co-operation between both States and to intensify co-operation between private enterprises,</p>
      <p>Intending to create favourable conditions for investments by nationals and legal persons of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party,</p>

    </preamble>
    <body>
      <div type="article" num="I">

        <p>3) The protection guaranteed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article shall at least be equal to that enjoyed by the nationals or legal persons of any third State and may in no case be less favourable than that recognized by international law.</p>
        <p>4) Nevertheless, the treatment and protection referred to in the preceding paragraphs shall not be extended to privileges which either Contracting Party accords to nationals or companies of a third country because of its membership in, or association with a customs union, a common market or a free trade area.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="II">

      </div>

        <p>3) The nationals or legal persons of either Contracting Party shall be accorded, in every case, in the territory of the other Contracting Party a treat ment no less favourable than that enjoyed by the nationals of any third State and in no case less favourable than that recognized by international law.</p>

        <p>3) In any event, the rates which are applied shall be fair and equitable, taking into account the usual levies and charges which may be imposed on exchange operations.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="VII">
        <p>In the event that one of the Contracting Parties, as a result of a financial guarantee given by it for an investment effected in the territory of the other Contracting Party, makes payment to its own nationals, companies or other legal persons, this Party is entitled, by virtue of subrogation, to exercise the rights and actions of these nationals, companies or other legal persons.</p>
        <p>The subrogation shall also apply to the right of transfer referred to in the above mentioned articles 4 and 5 .</p>

        <p>Nationals or companies of either Contracting Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Contracting Party owing to revolts, riots, armed conflicts or revolutions shall enjoy, on the part of this latter Party, treatment no less favourable than the treatment that Party accords to its own nationals or companies or those of a third State, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other considerations.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="IX">
        <p>Each Contracting Party hereby irrevocably and anticipator[il]y gives its consent to submit to conciliation and arbitration any dispute relating to a measure contrary to this Agreement, pursuant to the Convention on the settlement of investment disputes between States and nationals of other States of 18 March 1965, at the initiative of a national or legal person of the other Contracting Party, who considers himself to have been affected by such a measure.</p>
        <p>This consent implies renunciation of the requirement that the internal administrative or judicial resorts should be exhausted.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="X">
        <p>In the event of a dispute arising between the Contracting Parties as regards the interpretation or implementation of this Agreement, and if such dispute cannot be satisfactorily settled through the diplomatic channels within a six months' period, it shall be submitted upon the request of either Contracting Party to an arbitral tribunal composed of three members.</p>
        <p>Each Party shall appoint one arbitrator. The two arbitrators thus appointed shall appoint a third arbitrator who is not a national of either Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>If one of the Parties fails to appoint its arbitrator and has not proceeded to do so within two months after an invitation from the other Party, the arbitrator shall be appointed, at the request of the latter Party, by the President or Vice-President of the International Court of Justice.</p>
        <p>If within two months following their appointment the two arbitrators are unable to reach an agreement on the choice of the third arbitrator, the latter shall be appointed at the request of either Party, by the President or Vice-President of the International Court of Justice.</p>
        <p>The Tribunal shall take its decisions; it may, at any stage of the proceedings, propose to the Parties that the dispute should be settled amicably.</p>
        <p>If the Parties reach an agreement, the Tribunal shall decide ex aequo et bono.</p>
        <p>Unless the Parties otherwise decided, the Tribunal shall determine its own rules of procedure. The decisions of the Tribunal, taken by a majority of votes, shall be binding upon the Parties.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="XI">
        <p>In the event of any matter being provided as well in this Agreement as in an international agreement or in the national regulations of one of the Contracting Parties, no provision of this Agreement shall prevent a national or legal person of one of the Contracting Parties who possesses investments, goods, rights or interests, in the territory of the other Contracting Party, from availing himself of the most favourable provisions.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="XII">

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="XIII">
        <p>(1) The Contracting Parties will apply provisionally the present Agreement as from the date of its signature and definitely as from the exchange by Contracting Parties of diplomatic notes confirming the fulfillment of their constitutional requirements.</p>
