      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion and protection of investments">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting State shall as far as possible encourage investments from the other Contracting State in its territory and in accordance with its legislation shall admit such investments. Once established, investments shall enjoy full protection and security.</p>
        <p>(2) Each Contracting State shall accord fair and equitable treatment to the investments of investors of the other Contracting State. Each Contracting State shall ensure that the management, maintenance, use, and enjoyment, shall not in any way be impaired by arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory measures.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="National treatment and most favoured nation treatment">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting State shall accord investments made in its territory owned or controlled by investors of the other Contracting State treatment not less favourable than that which it accords in like situations to investments of its own investors or investors of any third State, whichever is the most favourable.</p>
        <p>(2) Each Contracting State shall accord investors of the other Contracting State, as regards management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, or disposal of their investments, means of asserting rights thereto, transfers, compensation, or any other associated activity therewith in its territory treatment not less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is the most favourable.</p>
        <p>(3) Such treatment shall not relate to privileges, benefits or incentives which either Contracting State accords to investors of third states on account of its membership of, or association with, any existing or interim agreements leading to a customs or economic union, a common market, a free trade area, a monetary union or similar international agreement.</p>
        <p>(4) The treatment granted under this Article shall not relate to advantages which either Contracting State accords to investors of third States by virtue of a double taxation agreement or other agreements regarding matters of taxation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="Protection of investments">
        <p>(1) Investments by investors of either Contracting State shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting State.</p>
        <p>(2) Investments by investors of either Contracting State shall not - neither directly nor indirectly through measures directed towards a company in which the investor holds an investment - be expropriated, nationalized or subjected to any other measure having effects equivalent to expropriation or nationalization (hereafter collectively referred to as "expropriation") by the other Contracting State except for the public benefit of that State and against prompt, adequate and just compensation and on condition that such measures are taken on a non-discriminatory basis and in accordance with domestic laws of general application. The legality of any such expropriation and the amount of compensation shall at the request of the investor be subject to review by due process of law.</p>
        <p>(3) Such compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market-value of the investment, as determined in accordance with recognised principles of valuation such as, inter alia, the capital invested, replacement value, appreciation, current returns, goodwill and other relevant factors, immediately prior to or at the time when the decision for expropriation was announced or became publicly known, whichever is the earlier. In the event that payment of compensation is delayed, such compensation shall be paid in an amount which would put the investor in a position not less favourable than the position in which he would have been, had the compensation been paid immediately on the date of expropriation. To achieve this goal the compensation shall include interest at the prevailing commercial rate, however, in no event less than the current LIBOR-rate from the date of expropriation until the date of payment. The determination of the amount of compensation in the absence of agreement being reached between the investor and the host state, shall at the request of the investor be referred to arbitration or local courts. The amount of compensation finally determined shall be promptly paid to the investor in freely convertible currencies and allowed to be freely transferred without undue delay.</p>
        <p>(4) The provisions of this Article shall apply to the current returns from an investment as well as, in the event of liquidation, to the proceeds from such liquidation.</p>
        <p>(5) Investments of either Contracting State or any of its investors shall not be subjected to sequestration, confiscation or any similar measures except under due process of law.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Compensation for damages or losses">
        <p>(1) Investors of one Contracting State whose investments in the territory of the other Contracting State suffer losses owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency, revolt, insurrection or riot or other similar events in the territory of the latter Contracting State shall be accorded by the latter Contracting State treatment, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement, not less favourable than that which the latter Contracting State accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State whichever is the most favourable. Resulting payments shall be in freely convertible currency and freely transferable without undue delay.</p>
        <p>(2) Investors of one Contracting State who in any of the events referred to in paragraph (1) suffer damage or loss in the territory of the other Contracting State resulting from:</p>
        <p>(a) Requisition of their investment or property by its forces or authorities,</p>
        <p>(b) Destruction of their investment or property by its forces or authorities which was not caused in combat action or was not required by the necessity of the situation,</p>
        <p>Shall be accorded prompt and adequate compensation for the damage or loss sustained during the period of requisitioning or as a result of the destruction of the property. Resulting payments shall be in a freely convertible currency and freely transferable without undue delay.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Free transfer">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting State shall guarantee to investors of the other Contracting State the free transfer of payments in connection with an investment, in particular:</p>
        <p>(a) Of the principal and additional amounts to maintain or increase the investment;</p>
        <p>(b) Of the returns;</p>
        <p>(c) In repayment of loans;</p>
        <p>(d) Of the proceeds from the liquidation or the sale of the whole or any part of the investment;</p>
        <p>(e) Of compensation provided for in Article 4 and 5;</p>
        <p>(f) Of payments referred to in Article 7.</p>
        <p>(2) These transfers shall be made without undue delay at the applicable rate of exchange.</p>
        <p>(3) In case no market exchange rate is established then the rate of exchange shall correspond to the cross-rate obtained from those rates which would be applied by the International Monetary Fund on the date of payment for conversion of the currencies concerned into Special Drawing Rights.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Subrogation">
        <p>(1) In the event that one Contracting State has provided a guarantee in respect of non-commercial risks for the investment effected by one of its investors in the territory of the other Contracting State, and has effected payment to said investor on the basis of that guarantee, the other Contracting State shall recognize the assignment and the enforcement of the rights of the investor to the first named Contracting State, whose right of subrogation shall not exceed the original rights of the investor. In relation to the transfer of payments to the Contracting State by virtue of this assignment, the provisions of Article 4, 5 and 6 shall apply.</p>
        <p>(2) Questions arising from the subrogation will be consulted among the Contracting States on the request of either side.</p>

        <p>Both Contracting States herewith declare their consent to submit the dispute to arbitration under the said Convention.</p>

        <p>(4) If the periods specified in paragraph (3) above have not been observed, either Contracting State may, in the absence of any other arrangement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting State or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting State or if he, too, is prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the court next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting State shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>(5) The Arbitral Tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be binding. Each Contracting State shall bear the cost of its member and of its representatives in the arbitral proceedings; the costs of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting States.
