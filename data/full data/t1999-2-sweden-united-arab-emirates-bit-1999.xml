        <p>(3) The arbitration tribunal shall be set up from case to case, each Contracting State appointing one member. These two members shall then agree upon a national of a third State with whom both Contracting States have diplomatic relations, as their chairman, to be appointed by the Governments of the two Contracting States.

In all other respects, the procedure of the arbitration tribunal shall be determined by tribunal itself.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Application of the Agreement">

        <p>(3) This Agreement shall apply to all investments, whether made before or after its entry into force, but shall not apply to any dispute concerning an investment which arose, or any claim concerning an investment which was settled before the entry into force of this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="12" title="Entry Into Force">
        <p>(1) This Agreement shall enter into force thirty days after the date of receipt of the latter of the two notifications by which either Contracting State shall inform the other that its constitutional requirements for the entry into force of this Agreement have been fulfilled.</p>
