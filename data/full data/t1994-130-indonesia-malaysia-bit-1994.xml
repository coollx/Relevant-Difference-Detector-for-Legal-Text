        <p>This Agreement shall apply to investments by investors of Malaysia in the territory of the Republic of Indonesia which have been previously granted admission in accordance with the Law No. 1 of 1967 concerning Foreign Investment and any law amending or replacing it, and to investments by investors of the Republic of Indonesia in the territory of Malaysia priory to as well as after the entry into force of this Agreement.</p>

        <p>Where a matter is governed simultaneously both by this Agreement and by another international agreement to which both Contracting Parties are parties, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent either Contracting Party or any of its investors who own investments in the territory of the other contracting Party from taking advantage of whichever rules are more favourable to this case.</p>
