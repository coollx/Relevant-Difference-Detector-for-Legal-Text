      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Protection">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall accord protection in its territory to investments made in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not hinder, by unjustified or discriminatory measures, the management, development, maintenance, use, enjoyment, expansion, sale or, as the case may be, the liquidation of such investments. Each Contracting Party shall comply with any other obligations it has undertaken in relation to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>

      <div type="article" num="5" title="Nationalization and Expropriation">
        <p>1. Nationalization, expropriation or any other measure with similar characteristics or effects (hereinafter referred to as "expropriation") taken by the authorities of a Contracting Party against investments made in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party may be applied only in the public interest, in accordance with the law, in a non-discriminatory manner and accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation to the investor or the investor's successor in title.</p>
        <p>2. Such compensation shall correspond to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately prior to the date on which the expropriation or the imminence thereof became public knowledge, whichever occurs first (hereinafter referred to as the "valuation date").

        <p>3. Such market value shall be calculated in a freely convertible currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing for that currency on the valuation date.</p>
        <p>The compensation shall include interest at a commercial rate fixed on a market basis for the currency of valuation from the date of expropriation until the date of payment.</p>
        <p>4.

        <p>5. Where a Contracting Party expropriates assets of an enterprise incorporated under the laws in force in any part of its own territory in which investors of the other Contracting Party have an interest, it shall ensure that the provisions of this Article are applied to secure the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation in respect of their investments to investors of the other Contracting Party who hold such interests.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Compensation for Losses">
        <p>Investors of a Contracting Party whose investments or income in the territory of the other Contracting Party suffer losses due to war, other armed conflict, state of national emergency, insurrection, riot or other similar circumstances, including losses resulting from requisition measures, shall be accorded, by way of restitution, indemnity, compensation or other arrangement, treatment no less favorable than that accorded by such Contracting Party to its own investors or to investors of any third State.</p>
        <p>Any payment made pursuant to this Article shall be prompt, adequate, effective and freely transferable.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Transfers">
        <p>1. In respect of investments made in its territory, each Contracting Party shall grant to investors of the other Contracting Party the free transfer of payments related to their investments and income, including in particular, but not limited to, the following:</p>
        <p>Investment income as defined in Article 1; Compensation as provided for in Articles 5 and 6; Proceeds from the sale or liquidation, in whole or in part, of an investment; Funds in repayment of loans related to an investment; Payments for the maintenance or development of the investment, such as funds for the purchase of raw or auxiliary materials, semi-finished or finished products, as well as for the replacement of equipment; Wages, salaries and other remuneration received by nationals of a Contracting Party for work or services performed in the territory of the other Contracting Party in connection with an investment.</p>
        <p>2.

        <p>3. The transfers referred to in this Agreement shall be made in freely convertible currencies and in accordance with the tax regulations of the Contracting Party receiving the investment.</p>
        <p>4. The Contracting Parties undertake to facilitate the procedures necessary to effect such transfers without undue delay, in accordance with the practices of international financial centers.</p>
        <p>In particular, no more than three months should elapse from the date on which the investor has duly submitted the necessary requests for the transfer to the time when the transfer actually takes place. Accordingly, both Contracting Parties undertake to complete within the said period the necessary formalities for the acquisition of foreign exchange and for its actual transfer abroad.</p>
        <p>5. The Contracting Parties agree to accord to the transfers referred to in this Article treatment no less favorable than that accorded to transfers arising from investments made by investors of any third State.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="More Favourable Conditions">
        <p>1. If the legislation of either Contracting Party, or obligations arising under international law, whether now existing or hereafter arising between the Contracting Parties in addition to this Agreement, provides for general or special regulations under which investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party are to be accorded treatment more favorable than that provided for in this Agreement, such regulations shall prevail over this Agreement to the extent that they are more favorable.</p>
        <p>2. Conditions more favorable than those provided for in this Agreement which have been agreed between a Contracting Party and investors of the other Contracting Party shall not be affected by this Agreement.</p>
      </div>

        <p>In the event that a Contracting Party or its designated agency has granted a financial guarantee relating to non-commercial risks in respect of an investment made by its investors in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter shall accept the subrogation of the first Contracting Party or its designated agency in respect of the economic rights of the investor from the time the first Contracting Party or its designated agency made the first payment under the guarantee granted. This subrogation shall make it possible for the first Contracting Party or its designated agency to be the direct beneficiary of all compensation payments to which the initial investor may be entitled.</p>
        <p>With respect to the rights of ownership, use, enjoyment or any other right in rem, subrogation shall only take place once the applicable legal requirements of the receiving Contracting Party have been complied with.</p>
