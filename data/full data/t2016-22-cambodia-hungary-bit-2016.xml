      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion and Protection of Investments">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create favourable conditions for investors of the other Contracting Party to make investments in its territory and, shall admit such investments in accordance with its laws and regulations.</p>
        <p>2. Investments and returns of investors of either Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>3. The Contracting Party shall not encourage investment by lowering domestic environmental, labour or occupational health and safety legislation or by relaxing core labour standards.

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="National and Most-favoured-nation Treatment">
        <p>1.

        <p>2 Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investors of the other Contracting Party, as regards management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investment, treatment which is fair and equitable and not less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable.</p>
        <p>3. The National and Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment provisions of this Agreement shall not apply to advantages accorded by a Contracting Party pursuant to its obligations as a member of a customs, economic, or monetary union, a common market or a free trade area.</p>

        <p>5. The provisions of this Article shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to the investors of the other Contracting Party, or to the investments or returns of investments of such investors the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege, which may be extended by the former Contracting Party by virtue of:</p>
        <p>a) Any forms of multilateral agreements on investments to which either of the Contracting Parties is or may become a party;</p>

The expropriation shall be carried out under due process of law, on a non-discriminatory basis and shall be accompanied by provisions for the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before expropriation or impending expropriation became public knowledge (whichever is earlier), shall include interest at a commercially reasonable rate from the date of expropriation to the date of actual payment and shall be made without delay, be effectively realizable and be freely transferable in a freely convertible currency.</p>

        <p>2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1 of this Article, investors of one Contracting Party who in any of the events referred to in that paragraph suffer losses in the territory of the other Contracting Party resulting from:</p>

        <p>b) Destruction of their investment or a part thereof by its forces or authorities which was not caused in combat action or was not required by the necessity of the situation shall be accorded by the Contracting Party, in whose territory the losses occurred, just, adequate and effective restitution or compensation.</p>

        <p>3. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed:</p>
        <p>a) To prevent any Contracting Party from taking any actions that it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests</p>
        <p>(i) Relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war and to such traffic and transactions in other goods, materials, services and technology undertaken directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military or other security establishment,</p>

        <p>a) The investor has no substantial business activities in the territory of the Contracting Party under whose law it is constituted, or</p>
        <p>b) The denying Contracting Party adopts or maintains measures with respect to the third state that prohibit transactions with such investor and its investments or that would be violated or circumvented if the benefits of the Agreement were accorded to the investments of investors.</p>
        <p>5. A Contracting Party's essential security interests may include interests and measures deriving from its membership in a customs; economic or monetary union, a common market or a free trade area.</p>
        <p>6.
