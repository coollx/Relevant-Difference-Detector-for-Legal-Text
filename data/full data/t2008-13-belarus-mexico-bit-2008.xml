        <p>2. An investor of a Contracting Party, on behalf of an enterprise legally constituted pursuant to the national legislation of the other Contracting Party, that is a legal person such investor owns or controls, may submit to arbitration a claim that the other Contracting Party has breached an obligation set forth in Chapter II, and that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.</p>

        <p>5. A disputing investor may submit a claim to arbitration on behalf of an enterprise of the other Contracting Party that is a legal person that the investor owns or controls, only if both the investor and the enterprise:</p>
        <p>(a) Consent to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section; and</p>
        <p>(b) Waive their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the national legislation of a Contracting Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Contracting Party that is alleged to be a breach under Chapter II, except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages, before an administrative tribunal or court under the national legislation of the disputing Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>6. The consent and waiver referred to in this Article shall be in writing, delivered to the disputing Contracting Party and included in the submission of a claim to arbitration.</p>
        <p>7. The applicable arbitration rules shall govern the arbitration except to the extent modified by this Section.</p>
        <p>8. A dispute may be submitted to arbitration provided that the investor has delivered to the disputing Contracting Party its notice of intent referred to in Article 12 no later than three years from the date that either the investor or the enterprise of the other Contracting Party that is a legal person that the investor owns or controls, first acquired or should have first acquired knowledge of the events which gave rise to the dispute.</p>
        <p>9. If the investor, or an enterprise that an investor owns or controls, submits the dispute referred to in paragraphs 1 or 2 above to the Contracting Party's competent judicial or administrative courts, the same dispute may not be submitted to arbitration as provided in this Section.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="14" title="Contracting party consent">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration in accordance with this Section.</p>
        <p>2. The consent and the submission of a claim to arbitration by the disputing investor shall satisfy the requirements of:</p>

        <p>1. Unless the disputing parties otherwise agree, the arbitral tribunal shall be composed by three arbitrators. Each disputing party shall appoint one arbitrator and the disputing parties shall agree upon a third arbitrator, who shall be the Chairman of the arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>2. If an arbitral tribunal has not been established within 90 days from the date on which the claim was submitted to arbitration, either because a disputing party failed to appoint an arbitrator or because the disputing parties failed to agree upon the Chairman, the Secretary-General of ICSID, upon request of any of the disputing parties, shall be asked to appoint, at his own discretion, the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed. Nevertheless, the Secretary-General of ICSID, when appointing the Chairman, shall assure that he or she is a national of neither of the Contracting Parties.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="16" title="Consolidation">
        <p>1. At the request of a disputing party in accordance with this Article, the Secretary General of ICSID may establish a consolidation tribunal under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules which shall conduct the proceedings in accordance with such rules, except as modified by this Section.</p>
        <p>2. In the interest of a fair and efficient resolution, and provided that the interests of any disputing party are not seriously harmed, a tribunal established under this Article may consolidate the proceedings when:</p>
        <p>(a) Two or more investors in relation with the same investment submit a claim to arbitration under this Section; or</p>
        <p>(b) Two or more claims arising from common legal or factual issues are submitted to arbitration.</p>
        <p>3. Upon request of a disputing party, a tribunal established under Article 13, awaiting the determination of the consolidation tribunal in accordance with paragraph 4 below, may stay the proceedings that it had initiated.</p>
        <p>4. A tribunal established under this Article, after hearing the disputing parties, may determine:</p>
        <p>(a) Assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine together, all or part of the claims; or</p>
        <p>(b) Assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine one or more of the claims, provided that in doing so it would contribute to the settlement of the other claims.</p>
        <p>5. A tribunal established under Article 13 shall lack jurisdiction to hear and determine a claim, or a part thereof, over which a consolidation tribunal has assumed jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>6. A disputing party that intends consolidation of a claim under this Article may request to the Secretary-General of ICSID the establishment of a tribunal, and shall specify in its request:</p>
        <p>(a) The name of the disputing Contracting Party or the disputing investors to be included in the consolidation process;</p>
        <p>(b) The nature of the order sought; and</p>

        <p>7. A disputing party shall deliver a copy of its request to the disputing Contracting Party or to any disputing investor to the proceedings sought to be consolidated.</p>
        <p>8. Within 60 days of receipt of the request, the Secretary-General of ICSID may establish a tribunal comprised of three arbitrators. One shall be a national of the disputing Contracting Party, and one shall be a national of the Contracting Party of the disputing investors; the third, the presiding arbitrator, shall be a national of a non-Contracting Party. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the disputing investors and the disputing Contracting Party from appointing the members of the tribunal by a special agreement.</p>
        <p>9. Where a disputing investor has submitted a claim to arbitration under Article 13 and has not been named in a request made under paragraph 6 above, a disputing investor or the disputing Contracting Party, as appropriate, may make a written request to the tribunal that the first disputing investor be included in an order made under paragraph 4 above, and shall specify in the request:</p>
