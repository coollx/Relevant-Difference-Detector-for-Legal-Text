      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Settlement of investment disputes between a contracting party and an investor of the other contracting party">
        <p>1. Any disputes arising between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party which involve:</p>
        <p>(a) An obligation entered into by that Contracting Party with the investor of the other Contracting Party regarding an investment by such investor; or</p>
        <p>(b) An alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Agreement with respect to an investment by such investor, shall be resolved amicably through consultation and negotiation.</p>

        <p>3. Such an arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way. Within two (2) months of the receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the tribunal.

The Chairman shall be appointed within two (2) months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>4. If within the periods' specified in paragraph 3 of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments.
