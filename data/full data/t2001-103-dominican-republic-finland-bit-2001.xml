        <p>2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1 of this Article, investors of one Contracting Party who, in any of the situations referred to in that paragraph, suffer losses in the territory of the other Contracting Party resulting from:</p>
        <p>(a) requisitioning of its investment or a part thereof by the latter's armed forces or authorities, or</p>
        <p>(b) destruction of its investment or a part thereof by the latter's armed forces or authorities, which was not required by the necessity of the situation,</p>

        <p>4.

        <p>2. Nothing in this Agreement shall require a Contracting Party to furnish or allow access to any confidential or proprietary information, including information concerning particular investors or investments, the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement or be contrary to its laws protecting confidentiality or prejudice legitimate commercial interests of particular investors. </p>
