          <p>2. Notwithstanding Articles 2 and 3, a Contracting Party may require an investor of the other Contracting Party or its investments to provide information concerning its investments solely for informational or statistical purposes.

          <p>1. In the event of an investment dispute between the claimant and the respondent, they should initially seek to resolve the dispute through consultation and negotiation, which may include the use of non-binding, third-party procedures.</p>
          <p>2. In the event that an investment dispute cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation within six months from the date on which the claimant requested in writing the respondent for consultation and negotiation, the claimant may submit to arbitration under this Article a claim:</p>
          <p>(a) That the respondent has breached an obligation under Section I, except an obligation under Articles 9, 18 and 20; and</p>
          <p>(b) That the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.</p>
          <p>3. At least 90 days before submitting any claim to arbitration under this Article, a claimant shall deliver to the respondent a written notice of its intention to submit the claim to arbitration (hereinafter referred to as "notice of intent"). The notice of intent shall specify:</p>
          <p>(a) The name and address of the claimant;</p>
          <p>(b) For each claim, the provision of Section I alleged to have been breached and any other relevant provisions;</p>
          <p>(c) The legal and factual basis for each claim; and</p>
          <p>(d) The relief sought and the approximate amount of damages claimed.</p>
          <p>4. Provided that six months have elapsed since the claimant requested in writing the respondent for consultation and negotiation, the claimant may submit a claim referred to in paragraph 2 to the arbitration:</p>
          <p>(a) Under the ICSID Convention, provided that both Contracting Parties are parties to the ICSID Convention;</p>
          <p>(b) Under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, provided that either Contracting Party, but not both, is a party to the ICSID Convention;</p>
          <p>(c) Under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules; or</p>
          <p>(d) If the disputing parties agree, under any other arbitration institution or arbitration rules.</p>
          <p>5. A claim shall be deemed submitted to arbitration under this Article when the claimant's notice of or request for arbitration:</p>
          <p>(a) Referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 36 of the ICSID Convention is received by the Secretary- General of ICSID;</p>
          <p>(b) Referred to in Article 2 of Schedule C of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules is received by the Secretary-General of ICSID;</p>
          <p>(c) Referred to Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, together with the statement of claim referred to in Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, is received by the respondent; or</p>
          <p>(d) Under any other arbitration institution or arbitration rules selected under subparagraph 4(d) is received by the respondent, unless otherwise specified by such institution or in such rules.</p>
          <p>6. (a) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to the submission of a claim to arbitration under this Article in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
          <p>(b) The consent under subparagraph (a) and the submission of a claim to arbitration under this Article shall satisfy the requirements of:</p>
          <p>(i) Chapter II of the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Additional Facility Rules for written consent of the parties; and</p>
          <p>(ii) Article II of the New York Convention for an agreement in writing.</p>
          <p>7. Notwithstanding paragraph 6, no claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Article if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under paragraph 2 and knowledge that the claimant has incurred loss or damage.</p>
          <p>8. No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Article unless the claimant:</p>
          <p>(a) Consents in writing to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Article; and</p>
          <p>(b) Waives in writing any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court of justice under the law of either Contracting Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in subparagraph 2(a) before any judgment or award has been delivered on the subject matter of the dispute under the abovementioned mechanisms.</p>
          <p>9. The waiver provided pursuant to subparagraph 8(b) shall cease to apply where the arbitral tribunal rejects the claim on the basis of a failure to meet the requirements of paragraph 3, 4, 7 or 8, or on any other procedural or jurisdictional grounds.</p>
          <p>10. Notwithstanding subparagraph 8(b), the claimant may initiate or continue an action that seeks interim injunctive relief that does not involve the payment of monetary damages before an administrative tribunal or court of justice under the law of the respondent.</p>
          <p>11. An arbitral tribunal established under paragraph 4 shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law.</p>
          <p>12. In an arbitration under this Article, the respondent shall not assert, as a defense, counterclaim, right of setoff or otherwise, that the claimant has received or will receive indemnification or other compensation for all or part of the alleged damages pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract.</p>
          <p>13. The arbitral tribunal may award only:</p>
          <p>(a) A judgment whether or not there has been a breach by the respondent of any obligation under Section I with respect to the claimant and its investments; and</p>
          <p>(b) One or both of the following remedies, only if there has been such a breach:</p>
          <p>(i) Monetary damages and applicable interest; and</p>
          <p>(ii) Restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide that the respondent may pay monetary damages and any applicable interest, in lieu of restitution.</p>
          <p>Without prejudice to the competence of the tribunal referred to in subparagraph (a), the arbitral tribunal shall not award a decision whether or not there has been a breach by the respondent of any obligation under the legislation of the respondent with respect to the claimant and its investments.</p>
          <p>The arbitral tribunal may also award cost and attorney's fees in accordance with applicable arbitration rules.</p>
          <p>14. The respondent may make available to the public in a timely manner all documents, including an award, submitted to, or issued by, an arbitral tribunal established under paragraph 4, subject to redaction of:</p>
          <p>(a) Confidential business information;</p>
          <p>(b) Information which is privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure under the laws and regulations of either Contracting Party;</p>
          <p>(c) Information which shall be withheld pursuant to the relevant arbitration rules;</p>
          <p>(d) Information the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement; and</p>
          <p>(e) Information the disclosure of which it considers to be contrary to its essential security interests.</p>
          <p>15. Unless the disputing parties agree otherwise, the place of arbitration shall be in a country that is a party to the New York Convention.</p>
          <p>16. The award rendered by the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding upon the disputing parties. This award shall be executed in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations, as well as relevant international law including the ICSID Convention and the New York Convention, concerning the execution of award in force in the country where such execution is sought.</p>
