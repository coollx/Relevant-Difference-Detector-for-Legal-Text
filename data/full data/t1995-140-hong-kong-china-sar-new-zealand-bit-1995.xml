      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Promotion and protection of investments and returns">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create favourable conditions for investors of the other Contracting Party to make investments in its area and, subject to its right to exercise powers conferred by its laws, shall admit such investments.</p>
        <p>2. Investments and returns of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, protection and security in the area of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its area of investors of the other Contracting Party. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it may have entered into with regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>3. The two Contracting Parties shall to the extent possible encourage exchanges of information on relevant investment matters.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="Treatment of investments">
        <p>1. Neither Contracting Party shall in its area subject investments or returns of investors of the other Contracting Party to treatment less favourable than that which it accords to investments or returns of investors of any other State or, subject to its laws and regulations, that which it accords to investments or returns of its own investors.</p>
        <p>2. Neither Contracting Party shall in its area subject investors of the other Contracting Party. as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments, to treatment less favourable than that which it accords to investors of any other State or, subject to its laws and regulations, that which it accords to investments or returns of its own investors.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Compensation for losses">
        <p>1. Investors of one Contracting Party whose investments in the area of the other Contracting Party suffer losses owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency, revolt, insurrection or riot in the area of the latter Contracting Party shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party treatment, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement, if any, no less favourable than that which the latter Contracting Party accords to its own investors or investors of any other State. Any resulting payments shall be freely convertible.</p>
        <p>2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1 of this Article, investors of one Contracting Party who in any of the situations referred to in that paragraph suffer losses in the area of the other Contracting Party resulting from:</p>

Investors of either Contracting party shall not be deprived of their investments nor subjected to measures having effect equivalent to such deprivation in the area of the other Contracting Party except lawfully, for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Party, on a non-discriminatory basis, and against compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the real value of the investment immediately before the deprivation or before the impending deprivation became public knowledge whichever is the earlier. Where that value cannot be readily ascertained, the compensation shall be determined in accordance with generally recognised principles of valuation and equitable principles taking into account the capital invested, depreciation, capital already repatriated, replacement value, currency exchange rate movements and other relevant factors. Compensation shall include interest at a normal commercial rate until the date of payment, shall be made without undue delay, be effectively realisable and be in a freely convertible currency. The investor affected shall have a right, under the law of the Contracting Party making the deprivation, to prompt review by a judicial or other independent authority of that Party, of the investor's case and of the valuation of the investment in accordance with the principles set out in this paragraph.</p>
        <p>2. Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its area, and in which investors of the other Contracting Party own shares, it shall ensure that the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article are applied to the extent necessary to guarantee compensation referred to in paragraph 1 in respect of their investment to such investors of the other Contracting Party who are owners of those shares.</p>

        <p>2. Transfers of currency shall be effected without delay in a freely convertible currency. Unless otherwise agreed by the investor transfers shall be made at the rate of exchange applicable on the date of transfer.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Exceptions">

        <p>(a) Any regional arrangement for customs, monetary, tariff or trade matters (including a free trade area) or any agreement designed to lead in the future to such a regional arrangement; or</p>
        <p>(b) Any arrangement with any other State or States in the same geographic region designed to promote regional cooperation in the economic, social, labour, industrial or monetary fields within the framework of specific projects.</p>

If no such procedures have been agreed within that six month period, the parties to the dispute shall be bound to submit it to arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law as then in force. The parties may agree in writing to modify those Rules.</p>

        <p>1. If any dispute arises between the Contracting Parties relating to the interpretation or application of this Agreement, the Contracting Parties shall in the first place try to settle it by negotiation.</p>
        <p>2. If the Contracting Parties fail to reach a settlement of the dispute by negotiation, it may be referred by them to such person or body as they may agree on or, at the request of either Contracting Party, shall be submitted for decision to a tribunal of three arbitrators which shall be constituted in the following manner:</p>
        <p>(a) Within sixty days after receipt of a request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one arbitrator.

        <p>(b) If within the time limits specified above any appointment has not been made, either Contracting Party may request the President of the International Court of Justice, in a personal and individual capacity, to make the necessary appointment within thirty days. If the President considers that he is a national of a State which cannot be regarded as neutral in relation to the dispute, the most senior Vice-President who is not disqualified on that ground shall make the appointment.</p>
        <p>3. Except as hereinafter provided in this Article, or as otherwise agreed by the Contracting Parties, the tribunal shall determine the limits of its jurisdiction and establish its own procedure. At the direction of the tribunal, or at the request of either of the Contracting Parties, a conference to determine the precise issues to be arbitrated and the specific procedures to be followed shall be held not later than thirty days after the tribunal is fully constituted.</p>
        <p>4. Except as otherwise agreed by the Contracting Parties or prescribed by the tribunal, each Contracting Party shall submit a memorandum within forty five days after the tribunal is fully constituted. Replies shall be due sixty days later. The tribunal shall hold a hearing at the request of either Contracting Party, or at its discretion, within thirty days after replies are due.</p>
        <p>5. The tribunal shall attempt to give a written decision within thirty days after completion of the hearing or, if no hearing is held, after the date both replies are submitted. The decision shall be taken by a majority vote.</p>
        <p>6. The Contracting Parties may submit requests for clarification of the decision within fifteen days after it is received and such clarification shall be issued within fifteen days of such request.</p>
        <p>7. The decision of the tribunal shall be final and binding on the Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>8. Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitration proceedings and half the costs of the President of the tribunal and the remaining costs, including any expenses incurred by the President or Vice-President of the International Court of Justice in implementing the procedures in paragraph 2(b) of this Article. The tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of the costs shall be borne by one of the two parties, and this decision shall be binding on both Contracting Parties.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Subrogation">
        <p>1. In the event that either Contracting Party (or any agency, institution, statutory body or corporation designated by it) as a result of an indemnity it has given in respect of an investment or any part thereof makes payment to its own investors in respect of any of their claims under this Agreement, the other Contracting Party acknowledges that the former Contracting Party (or any agency, institution, statutory body or corporation designated by it) is entitled by virtue of subrogation to exercise the rights and assert the claims of the investors that it has indemnified. The subrogated right or claim shall not be greater than the original right or claim of the said investors.</p>
        <p>2. Any payment made by one Contracting Party (or any agency, institution, statutory body or corporation designated by it) to its investors shall not affect the right of such investors to make their claims against the other Contracting Party in accordance with Article 9, in cases where the former Contracting Party elects not to exercise its subrogated rights or claims.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="12" title="Entry into force">
        <p>This Agreement shall enter into force thirty days after the date on which the Parties have notified each other in writing that their respective requirements for the entry into force of this Agreement have been complied with.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="13" title="Duration and termination">
        <p>1. This Agreement shall remain in force for a period of fifteen years and shall continue in force thereafter unless after the expiry of the initial period of fourteen years, either Contracting Party notifies in writing the other Contracting Party of its intention to terminate this Agreement. The notice of termination shall become effective one year after it has been received by the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>2. In respect of investments made prior to the date when the notice of termination becomes effective, the provisions of Articles 1 to 12 shall remain in force for a further period of fifteen years from that date.</p>
