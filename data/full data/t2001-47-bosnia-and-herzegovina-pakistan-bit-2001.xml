      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Settlement of investment disputes between a contracting party and an investor of the other contracting party">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party consents to submit to the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter referred to as "the Center") for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Dispute between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at Washington D.C. on 18th March, 1965 any dispute arising between the Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party which involves:</p>
        <p>a) An obligation entered into by that Contracting Party with the investor of the other Contracting Party regarding an investment by such investor; or</p>
        <p>b) An alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Agreement with respect to an investment by such investor.</p>
        <p>2. A company which is incorporated or constituted under the laws in force in the territory of one Contracting Party and in which before such a dispute arises the majority of shares are owned by investors of the other Contracting Party shall in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention be treated for the purpose of this Convention as a company of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>3.</p>
        <p>a) If any dispute referred to in paragraph 1 should arise, the Contracting Party and the investor concerned shall seek to resolve the dispute through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot thus be resolved within three (3) months, then if investor concerned also consents in writing to submit the dispute to the Center for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Convention, either party to the dispute may institute proceeding by addressing a request to that effect to the Secretary-General of the Center as set forth in Articles 28 and 36 of the Convention, provided that the investor concerned has not submitted the dispute to the courts of justice or administrative tribunals or agencies of competent jurisdiction of the Contracting Party that is party to the dispute.</p>
        <p>b) In the event of disagreement as to whether conciliation or arbitration is the more appropriate procedure, the opinion of the investor concerned shall prevail. The Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute shall not raise as an objection, defense or right of set-off in any stage of the proceedings or an enforcement of an award the fact that the investor which is the other party to the dispute has received or will receive, pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract, an indemnity or other compensation for all or part of his or its losses and damages.</p>
        <p>4. Neither Contracting Party shall pursue through diplomatic channels any dispute referred to the Center unless:</p>
        <p>a) The Secretary General of the Center, or a conciliation commission or an arbitral tribunal constituted by it, decides that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Center; or</p>
        <p>b) The other Contracting Party should fail to abide by or to comply with any award rendered by an arbitral tribunal.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Settlement of disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1. Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application to this Agreement should, if possible, be settled through diplomatic channels.</p>
        <p>2. If a dispute between the Contracting Parties cannot thus be settled, it shall upon the request of the either Contracting Party be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>3. Such an arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way. Within two months of the receipt of the request of arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the tribunal. Those two members shall then select a national of a third State who on approval by the two Contracting Parties shall be appointed Chairman of the tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within two (2) months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>4. If within the periods specified in the paragraph 3 of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he too is prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be binding on both Contracting Parties. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings; the cost of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. The tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the two Contracting Parties, and this award shall be binding on both Contracting Parties. The tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If a Contracting Party makes a payment to any of its investors under a guarantee it has granted in respect of an investment, the other Contracting Party shall, without prejudices to the rights of the former Contracting Party under Article 6, recognize the transfer of any right or title of such national or company to the former Contracting Party and the subrogation of the former Contracting Party to any right or title.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Application to investments">
        <p>This Agreement shall apply to investments made in the territory of either Contracting Party in accordance with its laws, regulations or national policies by investors of the other Contracting Party after the entry into force of this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Entry into force, duration and termination">
