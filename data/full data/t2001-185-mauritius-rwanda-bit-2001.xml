        <p>Shall be accorded restitution or adequate compensation, not less favourable than that which the latter Contracting Party accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State.</p>
      </div>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Settlement of disputes between an investor and a contracting party">
        <p>(1) Subject to paragraph (3) any dispute between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party in connection with an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably through negotiations between the parties to the dispute.</p>
        <p>(2) If the dispute cannot be settled through negotiations within six months, either party to the dispute shall be entitled to initiate judicial action before the competent court of the Contracting Party accepting the investment.</p>
        <p>(3) If a dispute involving the amount of compensation resulting from expropriation, nationalisation, or other measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation, mentioned in Article 6 cannot be settled within six months after resort to negotiation as specified in paragraph (1) of this Article by the investor concerned, it may be submitted to an international arbitral tribunal established by both parties.</p>
        <p>The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply if the investor concerned has resorted to the procedure specified in paragraph (2) of this Article.</p>
        <p>(4) The international arbitral tribunal mentioned above shall be specially constituted in the following manner. Each party to the dispute shall appoint an arbitrator. The two arbitrators shall appoint a third arbitrator as Chairman. The arbitrators shall be appointed within two months and the Chairman within four months from the date on which one party concerned notified the other party of its submission of the dispute to arbitration.</p>
        <p>(5) If the necessary appointments are not made within the period specified in paragraph (4), either party may, in the absence of any other agreement, request the Chairman of the International Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>(6) The arbitral tribunal shall, apart from what is stated below, determine its own arbitral procedures with reference to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States, done at Washington on 18 March 1965.</p>
        <p>(7) The tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes.</p>
        <p>(8) The decision of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding on both parties.</p>
        <p>(9) The arbitral tribunal shall state the basis of its decision and state reasons upon the request of either party.</p>
        <p>(10) Each party concerned shall bear the cost of its own arbitrator and its representation in the arbitral proceedings. The cost of the Chairman in discharging his arbitral function and the remaining costs of the tribunal shall be borne equally by the parties concerned. The tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the two parties, and this award shall be binding on both parties.</p>
        <p>(11) The provisions of this Article shall not prejudice the Contracting Parties from using the procedures specified in Article (9) where a dispute concerns the interpretation or application of this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>(1) Any dispute between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement should, if possible, be settled through negotiations between the Governments of the two Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>(2) If the dispute cannot be settled within a period of six months following the date on which such negotiations were requested by either Contracting Party, it may upon the request of either Contracting Party, be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>(3) Such an arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way: within two months of the receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one arbitrator for the tribunal. Those two arbitrators shall then select a national of a third State who, upon approval by the two Contracting Parties, shall be appointed Chairman of the tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two arbitrators.</p>
        <p>(4) If within the periods specified in paragraph (3) of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make any necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he too is prevented from discharging the said function, the Member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party and not prevented from discharging such functions shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>(5) The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be binding on both Contracting Parties. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own arbitrator to the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings. The cost of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne equally by the Contracting Parties. The tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the two Contracting Parties, and this award shall be binding on, and executed by, both Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>(6) Apart from the above, the tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Subrogation">
        <p>(1) If a Contracting Party or its designated agency makes a payment to its own investor under a guarantee it has given in respect of an investment made in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall recognise the assignment to the former Contracting Party of all the rights and claims of the indemnified investor, and shall also recognise that the former Contracting Party or its designated Agency is entitled to exercise such rights and enforce such claims by virtue of subrogation, to the same extent as the original investor.</p>
        <p>(2) Any payment made by one Contracting Party or its designated Agency to its own investor as provided in paragraph (1) shall not affect the right of such investor to make his claims against the other Contracting Party in accordance with Article 8 provided that the exercise of such a right does not overlap, or is not in conflict with, the exercise of a right in virtue of subrogation under that paragraph.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Application of other rules">
        <p>(1) If the provisions of the law of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties, in addition to the present Agreement, contain rules, whether general or specific, entitling investments and returns of investors of the other Contracting Party to treatment more favourable than that provided for by the present Agreement, such rules shall, to the extent that they are more favourable, prevail over the present Agreement.</p>
        <p>(2) Each Contracting Party shall, however, honour any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="12" title="Prohibitions and restrictions">
        <p>The provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way limit the right of either Contracting Party to apply prohibitions or restrictions of any kind or take any other action which is directed to the protection of its essential security interests, or to the protection of public health or the prevention of diseases and pests in animals or plants.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="13" title="Entry into force, duration and expiry">
        <p>(1) This Agreement shall apply to all investments made by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, whether made before or after the coming into force of this Agreement. For the avoidance of any doubt, it is declared that all investments shall, subject to this Agreement, be governed by the laws in force in the territory of the Contracting Party in which such investments are made.</p>
        <p>(2) The Contracting Parties shall notify each other promptly of the fulfilment of their legal procedures required for entry into force of this Agreement. The Agreement shall enter into force on the day following the date of receipt of the last notification.</p>
        <p>(3) This Agreement shall remain in force for a period of ten years. Thereafter it shall continue in force until the expiration of twelve months from the date on which either Contracting Party shall have given written notice of termination of this Agreement to the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>(4) In respect of investments approved and/or made prior to the date the notice of termination of this Agreement becomes effective, the provisions of the preceding articles shall remain in force with respect to such investments for a further period of ten years from that date or for any longer period as provided for or agreed upon in the relevant contract or approval granted to the investor.</p>
