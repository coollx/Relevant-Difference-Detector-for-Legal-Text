        <p>Dear Minister</p>
        <p>I have the honor to refer to the Agreement signed today between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of His Majesty the King of Nepal on the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments and to inform you that the interpretation of this Agreement is as follows, with respect to Article 3.</p>
        <p>(a) Any restriction on the purchase and transportation of raw and auxiliary materials, energy and fuel, and means of production and operation of any kind, any impediment to the sale and transportation of products within the country and abroad, and any other measures having a similar effect shall be deemed to be de jure or de facto impediments to fair and equitable treatment. Measures taken for reasons of public safety, public health or public order shall not be considered as legal or de facto barriers, provided that they are not abusive or discriminatory. I understand that the term "public morality" in Nepalese law is interchangeable with the term "ordre public" in French law.</p>
        <p>(b) The Contracting Parties shall give sympathetic consideration, within the framework of their respective legislation, to applications for entry, residence, work and travel permits by nationals of one Contracting Party for investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party.</p>
