    </title>
    <preamble>

      <p>RECOGNIZING that a fair and equitable treatment of investments on a reciprocal basis will serve this aim,</p>
      <p>HAVE AGREED as follows:</p>

        <p>4. The term "investor" means with respect to each Contracting Party: a) Natural persons having the citizenship or nationality of, or who are permanently residing in each Contracting Party in accordance with its laws.</p>
        <p>b) Any entity established in accordance with, and recognised as a legal person by the law of that Contracting Party, such as companies, firms, associations, development finance institutions, foundations or similar entities irrespective of whether their liabilities are limited and whether or not their activities are directed at profit.</p>

The term "territory" shall mean the area encompassed by land boundaries as well as the sea, seabed and its subsoil beyond the territorial sea over which the Contracting Party exercises, in accordance with its national laws and regulations and international law, sovereign rights or jurisdiction.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion and protection of investments">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall admit investments by investors of the other Contracting Party in accordance with its legislation and administrative practice and encourage such investments, including facilitating the establishment of representative offices.</p>
        <p>2. Investments of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory of investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>3. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Treatment of investments">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party fair and equitable treatment which in no case shall be less favourable than that accorded to its own investors or to investors of any third state, whichever is the more favourable from the point of view of the investor.</p>
        <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord investors of the other Contracting Party, as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investment, fair and equitable treatment which in no case shall be less favourable than that accorded to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever of these standards is the more favourable from the point of view of the investor.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="Exceptions">
        <p>The provisions of this Agreement relative to the granting of treatment not less favourable than that accorded to the investors of each Contracting Party or of any third State shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to the investors of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from:</p>
        <p>a) Membership of any existing or future Regional Economic Integration Organisation or customs union of which one of the Contracting Parties is or may become a party, or</p>
        <p>b) Any international agreement or arrangement relating wholly or mainly to taxation or any domestic legislation relating wholly or mainly to taxation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Expropriation and compensation">
        <p>1. Investments of investors of each Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as "expropriation") in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for expropriations made in the public interest, on a basis of non-discrimination, carried out under due process of law, and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation.</p>
        <p>2. Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or impending expropriation became known in such a way as to affect the value of the investment (hereinafter referred to as the "valuation date").</p>
        <p>3. Such fair market value shall be calculated in a freely convertible currency on the basis of the market rate of exchange existing for that currency on the valuation date. Compensation shall be paid promptly and include interest at a commercial rate established on a market basis from the date of expropriation until the date of payment and shall be freely transferable.</p>
        <p>4. The investor affected shall have a right to prompt review under the law of the Contracting Party making the expropriation, by a judicial or other competent and independent authority of that Contracting Party, of its case, of the valuation of its investment, and of the payment of compensation, in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 1 of this Article.</p>
        <p>5. When a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company or an enterprise in its territory, which is incorporated or constituted under its law, and in which investors of the other Contracting Party have an investment, the provisions of this Article shall apply to ensure prompt, adequate and effective compensation for those investors for any impairment or diminishment of the fair market value of such investment resulting from the expropriation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Compensation for losses">
        <p>1.

        <p>2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1 of this Article, an investor of a Contracting Party who, in any of the situations referred to in that paragraph, suffers a loss in the area of another Contracting Party resulting from</p>
        <p>a) Requisitioning of its investment or part thereof by the latter's forces or authorities, or</p>
        <p>b) Destruction of its investment or part thereof by the latter's forces or authorities, which was not required by the necessity of the situation,</p>
        <p>Shall be accorded restitution or compensation which in either case shall be prompt, adequate and effective and shall be freely transferable.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Transfer of capital and returns">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall upon payment of all financial obligations of investors of the other Contracting Party, guarantee to the investors of the other Contracting Party, free transfers of payments related to their investments including in particular, though not exclusively:</p>
        <p>a) The initial capital and any additional capital for the maintenance and development of an investment;</p>
        <p>b) The invested capital or the proceeds from the sale or liquidation of all or any part of an investment;</p>
        <p>c) Interest, dividends, profits and other returns realised;</p>

        <p>f) Unspent earnings and other remuneration of personnel engaged from abroad in connection with an investment;</p>
        <p>g) Compensation, restitution, indemnification or other settlement pursuant to Articles 5 and 6.</p>
        <p>h) Payments arising out of a settlement of a dispute, according to Articles 9 and 10,</p>
        <p>2. Transfers of payments under paragraph 1 of this Article shall be effected without delay and in a freely convertible currency.</p>
        <p>3. Transfers shall be made at the market rate of exchange existing on the date of transfer with respect to spot transactions in the currency to be transferred. In the absence of a market for foreign exchange, the rate to be used will be the most recent exchange rate applied to inward investments.</p>
        <p>4. The rights mentioned in this Article are without prejudice to measures adopted by the European Community in accordance with Articles 57(2), 59 and 60 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Subrogation">
        <p>1. If one Contracting Party or its designated agency makes a payment to its own investors under a guarantee it has accorded in respect of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall recognise:</p>
        <p>a) The assignment, whether under the law or pursuant to a legal transaction, of any right or claim by the investor to the former Contracting Party or to its designated agency and</p>
        <p>b) That the former Contracting Party or its designated agency is entitled by virtue of subrogation to exercise the rights and enforce the claims of that investor</p>
        <p>2. The rights or claims so subrogated shall not exceed the original rights or claims of the investor.</p>
        <p>3. Subrogation of the rights and obligations of the indemnified investor shall also apply to the transfer of payments affected in accordance with Article 7 of this Agreement.</p>
      </div>

        <p>b) The Additional Facility of the Centre, if the Centre is not available under the Convention; or</p>
        <p>c) An ad hoc tribunal set up under Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). The appointing authority under the said rules shall be the Secretary General of ICSID; or</p>
