      <p>1. Ad Article 1</p>
      <p>(a) Returns from the investment and, in the event of their reinvestment, the returns therefrom shall enjoy the same protection as the investment.</p>
      <p>(b) Without prejudice to any other method of determining nationality, in particular any person in possession of a national passport or a comparable document issued by the competent authorities of the Contracting Party concerned shall be deemed to be a national of that Contracting Party.</p>
      <p>2. Ad Article 2</p>
      <p>(a)  Investments made, in accordance with the legislation of either Contracting Party, within the territory of that Contracting Party by investors of the other Contracting Party shall enjoy the full protection of the Agreement.</p>
      <p>(b) The Agreement shall also apply to the areas of the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf insofar as international law permits the Contracting Party concerned to exercise sovereign rights or jurisdiction in these areas.</p>
      <p>3. Ad Article 3</p>
      <p>(a) The Palestinian Authority reserves the right to maintain exceptions to the principles of national treatment with regard to the acquisition of immovable property, provided that these exceptions are in accordance with the applicable law and non-discriminatory.</p>
      <p>(b) The following shall more particularly, though not exclusively, be deemed "activity" within the meaning of Article 3 (2): the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment and disposal of an investment. The following shall, in particular, be deemed "treatment less favourable" within the meaning of Article 3: unequal treatment in the case of restrictions on the pur- chase of raw or auxiliary materials, of energy or fuel or of means of production or operation of any kind, unequal treatment in the case of impeding the marketing of products inside or outside the country, as well as any other measures having similar effects. Measures that have to be taken for reasons of public security and order, public health or morality shall not be deemed "treatment less favourable" within the meaning of Article 3.</p>
      <p>(c) The provisions of Article 3 do not oblige a Contracting Party to extend to investors resident in the territory of the other Contracting Party tax privileges, tax exemptions and tax reductions which according to its tax laws are granted only to investors resident in its territory.</p>
      <p>(d) The Contracting Parties shall within the framework of their legislation give sympathetic consideration to applications for the entry and sojourn of persons of either Contracting Party who wish to enter the territory of the other Contracting Party in connection with an investment; the same shall apply to employed persons of either Contracting Party who in connection with an investment wish to enter the territory of the other Contracting Party and sojourn there to take up employment. Applications for work permits shall also be given sympathetic consideration.</p>
      <p>4. Ad Article 4</p>
      <p>A claim to compensation shall also exist when the economic substance of the company in which the investment is made is severely impaired as a result of measures taken by an authority.</p>
      <p>5. Ad Article 5</p>
      <p>(a) During an interim period until 31 December 2002, the Palestinian Authority will undertake every effort to make foreign exchange available for the free transfer, in particular for the transfer of returns. After this interim period Article 5 shall be applicable without restrictions.</p>
      <p>(b) Notwithstanding the above provision, payments of compensation in accordance with Article 4 shall be transferred freely.</p>
      <p>6. Ad Article 7</p>
      <p>A transfer shall be deemed to have been made "without delay" within the meaning of Article 7 (1) if effected within such period as is normally required for the completion of transfer formalities. The said period shall commence on the day on which the rele- vant request has been submitted and may on no account exceed two months.</p>
      <p>7. Whenever goods or persons connected with an investment are to be transported, each Contracting Party shall neither exclude nor hinder transport enterprises of the other Contracting Party and shall issue permits as required to carry out such transport.</p>
