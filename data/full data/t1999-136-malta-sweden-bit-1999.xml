    </title>
    <preamble>
      <p>The Government of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Government of Malta,</p>
      <p>Desiring to intensify economic co-operation to the mutual benefit of both countries and to maintain fair and equitable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party,</p>
      <p>Recognising that the promotion and reciprocal protection of such investments favour the expansion of the economic relations between the two Contracting Parties and stimulate investment initiatives,</p>
      <p>Have agreed as follows:</p>
    </preamble>
    <body>
      <div type="article" num="1" title="Definitions">
        <p>For the purposes of this Agreement:</p>
        <p>(1) The term investment means any kind of asset, acquired, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, provided that the investment has been made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the other Contracting Party, and shall include in particular, though not exclusively:</p>
        <p>(a) Movable and immovable property as well as any other property rights, such as mortgage, lien, pledge, usufruct and similar rights;</p>
        <p>(b) Shares and other kinds of interest in companies;</p>
        <p>(c) Title to money of any performance baving an economic value;</p>
        <p>(d) Intellectual property rights, technical processes, trade names, know-how, goodwill and other similar rights; and</p>
        <p>(e) Business concessions conferred by law, administrative decisions or under contract, including concessions to search for, develop, extract or exploit natural resources.</p>
        <p>A change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect their character as investments.</p>
        <p>Goods, that under a leasing agreement are placed at the disposal of a lessee in the territory of one Contracting Party by a lessor being an investor of the other Contracting Party, shall be treated no less favourably than an investment.</p>
        <p>(2) The term "investor" shall mean with regard to a Contracting Party:</p>
        <p>(a) Any natural person who is a national of that Contracting Party in accordance with its laws;</p>
        <p>(b) Any legal person constituted under the law of that Contracting Party and recognised as a resident of that Contracting Party and subject to its laws; and</p>
        <p>(c) Any legal person in which an ultimate controlling or predominant interest rests with a national or legal person of that Contracting Party as defined in (a) or (b).</p>
        <p>(3) "returns" shall mean the amounts yielded by an investment and in particular, though not exclusively, include profit, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties of fees.</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion and Protection of Investments">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall, subject to its general policy in the field of foreign investment, promote in its territory investments by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall admit such investments in accordance with its legislation.</p>
        <p>(2) Each Contracting Party shall, subject to its laws and regulations relating to the entry, stay and work of natural persons, examine in good faith requests by Investors of the other Contracting Party, and key personnel who are employed bu such Investors to enter and remain temporarily in its territory for the purpose of carrying out activities associated with an investment admitted in its territory.</p>
        <p>(3) Each Contracting Party shall at all times ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not, by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, in any way impair the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof as well as the acquisition of goods and service relating thereto, and the sale of their production.</p>
        <p>(4) The investments made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory they are undertaken, shall enjoy the full protection of this Agreement and in no case shall an investment be accorded treatment less favourable than that required by international law. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>(5) Reinvested returns yielded from an investment shall be given the same treatment and protection as an investment.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="National and Most Favoured Treatment of Investments">
        <p>(1) Neither Contracting Party shall subject investments made in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment which is less favourable than that accorded to investments made by its own investors or by investors of third States, whichever is the more favourable.</p>
        <p>(2) Neither Contracting Party shall subject in its territory investors of the other Contracting Party, as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investment, to treatment less favourable than that accorded to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is the more favourable.</p>
        <p>(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph (1) and (2) of this Article, a Contracting Party which has concluded or may conclude an agreement regarding the formation of a customs union, a common market or a freetrade area shall be free to grant more favourable treatment to investments by investors of the State or States which are also parties to the aforesaid agreements, or by investors of some of these States.</p>
        <p>(4) The provisions of Paragraph (1) and (2) of this Article shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to investors of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from any international agreement or arrangement relating wholly or mainly to taxation or any domestic legislation relating wholly or mainly to taxation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="Expropriation and Compensation">
        <p>(1) Neither Contracting Party shall take any measures depriving, directly or indirectly, an investor of the other Contracting Party of an investment unless the following conditions are complied with:</p>

        <p>(b) The measures are distinct and not discriminatory; and</p>
        <p>(c) The measures are accompanied by provisions for the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation, which shall be transferable to any other State selected by the investor without delay in a freely convertible currency.</p>
        <p>(2) Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the expropriated investment at the time immediately before the expropriation occurred (herinafter referred to as the "Valuation Date"). The fair market value shall not reflect any change in value occurring because the expropriation had become publicly known earlier.</p>
        <p>Such fair market value shall at the request of the investor be expressed in a freely convertible currency on the basis of the market rate of exchange existing for that currency on the Valuation Date. Compensation shall also include interest at a commercial rate establushed on a market basis from the date of expropriation until the date of payment.</p>
        <p>(3) The provision of Paragraph (1) of this Article shall also apply to the returns from a investment as well as, in the event of liquidation, to the proceeds from the liquidation.</p>
        <p>(4) Investors of either Contracting Party who suffer losses of their investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party due to war or other armed conflict, a state of national emergency, revolt, insurrection or riot shall be accorded, with respect to restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement, a treatment which is no less favourable than that accorded to its own investors or to investors of any third State. Resulting payments shall be transferable without delay and in a freely convertible currency to any other State selected by the investor.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Transfers">

        <p>(b) The proceeds from a total or partial sale or liquidation of any investment by an investor of the other Contracting Party;</p>
        <p>(c) Funds in repayment of loans; and</p>

        <p>(2) Any transfer referred to in this Agreement shall be effected at the market rate of exchange existing on the day of transfer with respect to spot transactions in the currency to be transferred. In the absence of a market for foreign exchange, the rate to be used will be the most recent rate applied to inward investments or the most recent exchange rate for conversion of currencies into Special Drawing Rights, whichever is the more favourable to the investor.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If a Contracting Party or its designated agency makes a payment to any of its investors under a guarantee it has granted in respect of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall, without prejuduce to the rights of the former Contracting Party under Article 8, recognise the transfer of any right or title of such an investor to the former Contracting Party or its designated agency.</p>

If the parties to such a dispute do not agree as to whether resort to local remedies, conciliation or arbitration is the more appropriate method of settlement, the investor shall have the right to choose.</p>
        <p>(3) For the purpose of this Article and in accordance with Article 25 (2) (B) of the said Washington Convention, any legal person which is constituted in accordance with the legislation of one Contracting Party and in which, before a dispute arises, an investor of the other Contracting Party held a predominant interest shall be treated as a legal person of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>(4) If it is not expedient or possible to obtain settlement through the Centre itself, each Contracting Party hereby consents that the dispute, at the choice of the investor, shall be submitted for settlement by binding arbitration either to the Additional Facility of the Centre or to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal to be set up under the Arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade law (UNCITRAL).
