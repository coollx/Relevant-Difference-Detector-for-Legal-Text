      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion and protection of investments">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create favourable conditions for investors of the other Contracting Party to invest in its territory and shall admit such investment in accordance with its laws, regulations and national policies.</p>
