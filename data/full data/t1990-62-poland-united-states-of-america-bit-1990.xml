A decision of a Party which denies entry if an investment shall not constitute an investment dispute within the meaning of this Article.</p>
        <p>2. In the event of an investment dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party, the parties to the dispute shall initially seek to resolve the dispute by consultation and negotiation, which may include the use of non-binding, third party procedures. Each Party shall encourage its nationals and companies to resort to local courts, especially for the resolution of disputes relating to administrative actions. Subject to paragraph 3 of this Article, if the dispute cannot be resolved through consultation and negotiation, the dispute shall be submitted for settlement in accordance with previously agreed, applicable dispute-settlement procedures. Any dispute-settlement procedures, including those relating to expropriation, specified in the investment agreement shall remain binding and shall be enforceable in accordance with the terms of the investment agreement, relevant provisions of domestic laws and applicable international agreements regarding enforcement if arbitral awards.</p>
        <p>3. (a) At any time after six months from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by conciliation or binding arbitration to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes ("Centre") or to the Additional Facility of the Centre or pursuant to the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law ("UNCITRAL") or pursuant to the arbitration rules of any arbitral institution mutually agree between the parties to the dispute. Once the national or company concerned has so consented, either party to the dispute may institute such proceeding provided:</p>
        <p>(i) The dispute has not been submitted by the national or company for resolution in accordance with any applicable previously agreed dispute-settlement procedures; and</p>
        <p>(ii) The national or company concerned has not brought the dispute before the courts of justice or administrative tribunals or agencies of competent jurisdiction of the Party that is a party to the dispute.</p>
        <p>If the parties disagree over whether conciliation or binding arbitration is the more appropriate procedure to be employed, the opinion of the national or company concerned shall prevail.</p>
        <p>(b) Each Party hereby consents to the submission of an investment dispute for settlement by conciliation or binding arbitration:</p>
        <p>(i) To the Centre, in the event that the Republic of Poland becomes a party to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States done at Washington, March 18, 1965 ("Convention") and the Regulations and Rules of the Centre, and to the Additional Facility of the Centre, and</p>
        <p>(ii) To an arbitral tribunal established under the UNCITRAL Rules, as those Rules may be modified by mutual agreement of the parties to the dispute, the appointing authority referenced therein to be Secretary General of the Centre.</p>

        <p>(d) The place of any arbitration conducted under this Article shall be a country which is a party to the 1958 United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.</p>
        <p>(e) Each Party undertakes to carry out without delay the provisions of any award resulting from an arbitration held in accordance with this Article. Further, each Party shall provide for the enforcement in its territory of such arbitral awards.</p>
        <p>4. In any proceeding involving an investment dispute, a Party shall not assert, as defense, counterclaim, right of set-off or otherwise, that the national or company concerned has received or will receive, pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract, indemnification or other compensation for all or part of its alleged damages. However, to the extent that a Party succeeds to the rights or claims of the national or company concerned by reason of subrogation or assignment, the national or company concerned shall not continue to pursue such rights and claims in its own name unless authorized to do so on behalf of the subrogee or assignee.</p>
        <p>5. In the event of an arbitration, for the purposes of this Article any company legally constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of either Party or a political subdivision thereof but that, immediately before the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to the dispute, was an investment of nationals or companies of the other Party, shall be treated as a national or company of such other Party, in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention.</p>

In the absence of an agreement by the Parties to the contrary, the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), except to the extent modified by the Parties or by the arbitrators, shall govern.</p>
        <p>3. Within two months of receipt of a request, each Party shall appoint an arbitrator. The two arbitrators shall select a third arbitrator as Chairman, who is a national of a third State.

        <p>4. Unless otherwise agreed, all submissions shall be made and all hearings shall be completed within six months of the date of selection of the third arbitrator, and the Tribunal shall render its decisions within two months of the date of the final submissions or the date of the closing of the hearings, whichever is later.</p>
