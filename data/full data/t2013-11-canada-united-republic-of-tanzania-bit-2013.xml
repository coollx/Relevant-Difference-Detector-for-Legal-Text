          <p>(g)  to supply exclusively from the territory of the Party a good that the investment produces or a service it provides to a specific regional market or to the world market.</p>
          <p>2.  A measure that requires an investment to use a technology to meet generally applicable health, safety or environmental requirements is not inconsistent with subparagraph 1(f).</p>
          <p>3.  A Party may not condition the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with an investment in its territory of an investor of a Party or of a nonParty, on compliance with the following requirements:</p>
          <p>(a)  to achieve a given level or percentage of domestic content;</p>
          <p>(b)  to purchase, use or accord a preference to a good produced in its territory, or to purchase a good from a producer in its territory;</p>
          <p>(c)  to relate the volume or value of imports to the volume or value of exports or to the amount of foreign exchange inflows associated with that investment; or</p>
          <p>(d)  to restrict sales of a good or service in its territory that the investment produces or provides by relating those sales to the volume or value of its exports or foreign exchange earnings;</p>
          <p>4.</p>
          <p>(a)  Paragraph 3 does not prevent a Party from conditioning the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with an investment in its territory of an investor of a Party or of a non-Party, on compliance with a requirement to locate production, provide a service, train or employ workers, construct or expand particular facilities, or carry out research and development, in its territory;</p>

        </div>
        <div type="article" num="10&#xA0;" title="Expropriation">
          <p>1.  A Party shall not nationalize or expropriate covered investments either directly or indirectly through measures having an effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as "expropriation") except for a purpose which is in the public interest, in accordance with due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner and on payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.</p>
          <p>2.  Such compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation took place ("date of expropriation"), and shall not reflect any change in value occurring because the intended expropriation had become known earlier. Valuation criteria shall include going concern value, asset value including the declared tax value of tangible property, and other criteria to determine fair market value.</p>
          <p>3.  Compensation shall be paid without delay and shall be fully realizable and freely transferable. Compensation shall be payable in a freely convertible currency and shall include interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that currency from the date of expropriation until date of payment.</p>
          <p>4.  The investor affected shall have a right under the law of the expropriating Party to prompt review of its case and of the valuation of its investment by a judicial or other independent authority of that Party in accordance with the principles set out in this Article.</p>
          <p>5.  For the purposes of this Article, direct expropriation occurs where an investment is nationalised or otherwise directly expropriated through formal transfer of title or outright seizure and indirect expropriation results from a measure or series of measures of a Party that have an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.</p>
          <p>In the context of a any dispute arising under Section C, the determination of whether a measure or series of measures of a Party constitute an indirect expropriation shall be determined through a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that shall consider, among other factors:</p>
          <p>(a)  the economic impact of the measure or series of measures, although the sole fact that a measure or series of measures of a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment shall not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred;</p>
          <p>(b)  the extent to which the measure or series of measures interfere with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; and</p>
          <p>(c)  the character of the measure or series of measures.</p>
          <p>Except in rare circumstances, such as when a measure or series of measures are so severe in the light of their purpose that they cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith, non-discriminatory measures of a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as health, safety and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriation.</p>
          <p>6.  This Article shall not apply to the issuance of compulsory licenses granted in relation to intellectual property rights, or to the revocation, limitation or creation of intellectual property rights, to the extent that such issuance, revocation, limitation or creation is consistent with applicable international trade agreements to which both Parties are party.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="11" title="Transfers (1)">
          <p>1.  Each Party shall permit all transfers relating to covered investments to be made freely and without delay, into and out of its territory. Such transfers include:</p>
          <p>(a)  contributions to capital;</p>
          <p>(b)  profits, dividends, interest, capital gains, royalty payments, management fees, technical assistance and other fees, returns in kind and other amounts derived from the covered investment;</p>
          <p>(c)  proceeds from the sale of all or any part of covered investments or from the partial or complete liquidation of covered investments;</p>
          <p>(d)  payments made under a contract entered into by the investor, or covered investments, including payments made pursuant to a loan agreement;</p>
          <p>(e)  payments made pursuant to Articles 7 (Compensation for Losses) and 10 (Expropriation); and</p>
          <p>(f)  payments arising under Section C.</p>
          <p>2.  Each Party shall permit transfers relating to covered investments to be made in the convertible currency in which the capital was originally invested, or in any other convertible currency agreed to by the investor and the Party concerned. Unless otherwise agreed by the investor, transfers shall be made at the market rate of exchange applicable on the date of transfer.</p>
          <p>3.  Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, a Party may prevent a transfer through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of its laws relating to:</p>
          <p>(a)  bankruptcy, insolvency or the protection of the rights of creditors;</p>
          <p>(b)  issuing, trading or dealing in securities;</p>
          <p>(c)  criminal or penal offences;</p>
          <p>(d)  reports of transfers of currency or other monetary instruments; or</p>
          <p>(e)  ensuring the satisfaction of judgments in adjudicatory proceedings.</p>
          <p>4.  A Party may not require its investors to transfer, or penalize its investors for failure to transfer, the income, earnings, profits or other amounts derived from, or attributable to, investments in the territory of the other Party.</p>
          <p>5.  Paragraph 4 shall not be construed to prevent a Party from imposing any measure through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of its laws relating to the matters in subparagraphs (a) through (e) of paragraph 3.</p>
          <p>6.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 4, and without limiting the applicability of paragraph 5, a Party may prevent or limit transfers by a financial institution to, or for the benefit of, an affiliate of or person related to such institution, through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of measures relating to maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or financial responsibility of financial institutions.</p>
          <p>7.  Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a Party may restrict transfers of returns in kind in circumstances where it could otherwise restrict transfers under the international agreements to which both Parties are party and as set out in paragraph 3.</p>
          <div type="foot_note">(1) It is understood that in accordance with Article 14 (Transfers), nothing in the Agreement prevents a Party from requiring, prior to the transfer of payments relating  to a covered investment and in accordance with its tax laws and regulations, the fulfilment by investors of tax obligations in relation to such an investment.</div>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="12" title="Transparency">
          <p>1.  Each Party shall ensure that its laws, regulations, procedures, and administrative rulings of general application respecting any matter covered by this Agreement are published or otherwise made available in a timely manner so as to enable interested persons and the other Party to become acquainted with them.</p>
          <p>2.  Each Party shall if required by its laws and regulations:</p>
          <p>(a)  publish in advance any such measure that it proposes to adopt; and</p>
          <p>(b)  provide interested persons and the other Party a reasonable opportunity to comment on such proposed measures.</p>
          <p>3.  Upon request by a Party, information shall be exchanged on the measures of the other Party that may have an impact on covered investments.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="13" title="Subrogation">
          <p>1.  If a Party or any agency makes a payment to any of its investors under a guarantee or a contract of insurance it has entered into in respect of an investment, the other Party shall recognize the validity of the subrogation in favour of such Party or agency to any right or title held by the investor.</p>
          <p>2.  A Party or any agency that is subrogated to the rights of an investor in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be entitled in all circumstances to the same rights as those of the investor in respect of the investment. Such rights may be exercised by the Party or any agency, or by the investor if the Party or any agency so authorizes.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="14" title="Taxation measures">
          <p>1.  Except as set out in this Article, this Agreement shall not apply to taxation measures.</p>
          <p>2.  This Agreement shall not affect the rights and obligations of the Parties under any tax convention. In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and any such convention, that convention shall apply to the extent of the inconsistency.</p>
          <p>3.  This Agreement shall not be construed to require a Party to furnish or allow access to information the disclosure of which would be contrary to the Party's law protecting information concerning the taxation affairs of a taxpayer.</p>
          <p>4.  Subject to paragraph 2, the provisions of Articles 4 (National Treatment) and 5 (Most Favoured Nation Treatment) shall apply to all taxation measures, other than taxation measures on income, capital gains or on the taxable capital of corporations, except that nothing in those Articles shall apply (2):</p>
          <p>(a)  to a non-conforming provision of any existing taxation measure, to its continuation or prompt renewal or to its amendment to the extent that the amendment does not decrease its conformity at the time of the amendment with any of those Articles;</p>
          <p>(b)  to any new taxation measure that is aimed at ensuring the equitable and effective imposition or collection of taxes (including, for greater certainty, any measure that is taken by a Party to ensure compliance with the Party's taxation system or to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes) and that does not arbitrarily discriminate between persons, goods or services of the Parties.</p>
          <p>5.  Provided that the conditions in paragraph 6 are met:</p>
          <p>(a)  a claim by an investor that a taxation measure of a Party is in breach of an agreement between a central government authority of a Party and the investor concerning an investment shall be considered a claim for breach of this Agreement; and</p>
          <p>(b)  the provisions of Article 10 (Expropriation) shall apply to taxation measures.</p>
          <p>6.  An investor may not make a claim pursuant to paragraph 5 unless:</p>
          <p>(a)  the investor provides a copy of the notice of claim to the taxation authorities of the Parties; and</p>
          <p>(b)  six months after receiving notification of the claim by the investor, the taxation authorities of the Parties fail to reach a joint determination that, in the case of 5(a), the measure does not contravene such determination, or that, in the case of 5(b), the measure in question is not an expropriation</p>
          <p>7.  If, in connection with a claim by an investor of a Party or a dispute between the Parties, an issue arises as to whether a measure of a Party is a taxation measure, a Party may refer the issue to the taxation authorities of the Parties. A decision of the taxation authorities shall bind any Tribunal formed pursuant to Section C (Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and the Host Party) or arbitral panel formed pursuant to Section D (State-to-State Dispute Settlement Procedures). A Tribunal or arbitral panel seized of a claim or a dispute in which the issue arises may not proceed pending receipt of the decision of the taxation authorities. If the taxation authorities have not decided the issue within six months of the referral, the Tribunal or arbitral panel shall itself decide the issue.</p>
          <p>8.  The taxation authorities referred to in this Article shall be the following until otherwise notified by a Party:</p>
          <p>(a)  for Canada: the Assistant Deputy Minister, Tax Policy, of the Department of Finance or his successor;</p>
          <p>(b)  for the United Republic of Tanzania: the Minister responsible for Finance or an authorized representative of the Minister or his successor.</p>
          <div type="foot_note">(2) It is understood that Article 14 (4) (Taxation Measures) does not apply to taxation measures that are the object of the Agreement between Canada and the United Republic of Tanzania for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital, done at Dar es Salaam on 15 December 1995.</div>

        <div type="article" num="15" title="Health, safety and environmental measures">
          <p>The Parties recognize that it is inappropriate to encourage investment by relaxing domestic health, safety or environmental measures. Accordingly, a Party should not waive or otherwise derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from, such measures as an encouragement for the establishment, acquisition, expansion or retention in its territory of an investment of an investor. If a Party considers that the other Party has offered such an encouragement, it may request consultations with the other Party and the two Parties shall consult with a view to avoiding any such encouragement.</p>

          <p>6.  In respect of intellectual property rights, a Party may derogate from Articles 4 (National Treatment) and 5 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) in a manner that is consistent with the WTO Agreement.</p>
          <p>7.  The provisions of Articles 4 (National Treatment), 5 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), 8 (Senior Management, Boards of Directors, and Entry of Personnel) and 9 (Performance Requirements) shall not apply to procurement by a Party.</p>
