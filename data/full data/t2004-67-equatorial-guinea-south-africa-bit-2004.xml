        <p>(b)  destruction of their property by the forces or authorities of the latter Party, which was not caused in combat action or was not required by the necessity of the situation,</p>
        <p>Shall be accorded restitution or adequate compensation.</p>

        <p>(2)  Such compensation shall be at least equal to the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, hereinafter referred to as "date of valuation".</p>
        <p>(3)  The value of the compensation will be calculated in a freely convertible currency according to the actual market rate for that currency on the date of that transaction.</p>

        <p>(5)  If one of the Parties expropriates the assets of a company that is established in its territory according to its domestic laws and in which there is participation of investors from the other Party, the first Party will have to ensure that the dispositions of the present Article are applicable so that it will guarantee that such investors will get a quick and effective compensation.</p>
