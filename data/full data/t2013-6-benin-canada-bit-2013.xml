          <p>(g) to supply exclusively from its territory a good that the investment produces or a service it provides to a specific regional market or to the world market.</p>
          <p>2. A measure that requires an investment to use a technology to meet generally applicable health, safety or environmental requirements is not inconsistent with subparagraph 1(f).</p>
          <p>3. A Contracting Party may not condition the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with an investment in its territory of an investor of a Contracting Party or of a non-Party, on compliance with the following requirements:</p>
          <p>(a) to achieve a given level or percentage of domestic content;</p>

          <p>1. A Contracting Party may not nationalize or expropriate a covered investment either directly or indirectly through measures having an effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation ("expropriation"), except for a public purpose, in accordance with due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner and on payment of compensation in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3. For greater certainty, this paragraph shall be interpreted in accordance with Annex I.</p>
          <p>2. The compensation referred to in paragraph 1 must be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation took place ("date of expropriation"), and must not reflect a change in value occurring because the intended expropriation had become known earlier. Valuation criteria must include going concern value, asset value including the declared tax value of tangible property, and other criteria, as appropriate, to determine fair market value.</p>
          <p>3. Compensation shall be paid without delay and shall be fully realizable and freely transferable. Compensation shall be paid in a freely convertible currency and shall include interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that currency accrued from the date of expropriation until the date of payment.</p>
          <p>4. The affected investor shall have a right under the law of the expropriating Contracting Party to prompt review of its case and of the valuation of its investment by a judicial or other independent authority of that Contracting Party in accordance with the principles set out in this Article.</p>
          <p>5. This Article does not apply to the issuance of a compulsory licence granted in relation to intellectual property rights, or to the revocation, limitation or creation of an intellectual property right, to the extent that the issuance, revocation, limitation or creation is consistent with the WTO Agreement.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="12" title="Transfers:">
          <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall permit all transfers relating to a covered investment to be made freely, and without delay, into and out of its territory. Those transfers include:</p>

          <p>(d) payments made under a contract entered into by the investor or the covered investment, including payments made pursuant to a loan agreement;</p>
          <p>(e) payments made under Articles 8 (Compensation for Losses) and 11 (Expropriation); and</p>
          <p>(f) payments arising under Chapter III.</p>
          <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall permit transfers relating to a covered investment to be made in the convertible currency in which the capital was originally invested, or in another convertible currency agreed to by the investor and the Contracting Party concerned. Unless otherwise agreed by the investor, transfers shall be made at the market rate of exchange in effect on the date of transfer.</p>
          <p>3. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, a Contracting Party may prevent a transfer through the equitable, non discriminatory and good faith application of its domestic law relating to:</p>
          <p>(a) bankruptcy, insolvency or the protection of the rights of a creditor;</p>
          <p>(b) issuing, trading or dealing in securities;</p>
          <p>(c) a criminal or penal offence;</p>
          <p>(d) financial reporting or record keeping of transfers when necessary to assist law enforcement or financial regulatory authorities; or</p>
          <p>(e) ensuring compliance with an order or judgment rendered in judicial or administrative proceedings.</p>
          <p>4. A Contracting Party may not require one of its investors to transfer, or penalize one of its investors for failing to transfer, the income, earnings, profits or other amounts derived from, or attributable to, an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party.</p>
          <p>5. Paragraph 4 does not prevent a Contracting Party from imposing a measure through the equitable, non discriminatory and good faith application of its domestic law relating to the matters in subparagraphs 3(a) through 3(e).</p>
          <p>6. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 4, and without limiting the applicability of paragraph 5, a Contracting Party may prevent or limit transfers by a financial institution to, or for the benefit of, an affiliate of or person related to that institution, through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of a measure relating to maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or financial responsibility of financial institutions.</p>
          <p>7. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a Contracting Party may restrict transfers of returns in kind in circumstances where it could otherwise restrict those transfers under the WTO Agreement and as set out in paragraph 3.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="13" title="Transparency:">
          <p>1.

          <p>2. To the extent possible, each Contracting Party shall:</p>
          <p>(a) publish in advance any measure referred to in paragraph 1 that it proposes to adopt; and</p>
          <p>(b) provide interested persons and the other Contracting Party a reasonable opportunity to comment on that proposed measure.</p>
          <p>3. Upon request by a Contracting Party, the other Contracting Party shall provide information on a measure that may have an impact on a covered investment.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="14" title="Subrogation:">
          <p>1. If a Contracting Party or an agency of a Contracting Party makes a payment to one of its investors under a guarantee or a contract of insurance it has entered into in respect of an investment, the other Contracting Party shall recognize the validity of the subrogation in favour of the first-mentioned Contracting Party or agency to a right or title held by the investor.</p>
          <p>2. A Contracting Party or an agency of a Contracting Party, that is subrogated to a right of an investor in accordance with paragraph 1, is entitled to the same rights as those of the investor regarding the investment. Those rights may be exercised by the Contracting Party or an agency of the Contracting Party or by the investor if the Contracting Party or its agency so authorizes.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="15" title="Health, safety and environmental measures:">
          <p>The Parties recognize that it is inappropriate to encourage investment by relaxing domestic health, safety or environmental measures. Accordingly, a Contracting Party should not waive or otherwise derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from, those measures to encourage the establishment, acquisition, expansion or retention in its territory of an investment of an investor. If a Contracting Party considers that the other Contracting Party has offered such an encouragement, it may request consultations with the other Contracting Party and the two Contracting Parties shall consult with a view to avoiding the encouragement.</p>

        <div type="article" num="16" title="Corporate social responsibility:">
          <p>Each Contracting Party should encourage enterprises operating within its territory or subject to its jurisdiction to voluntarily incorporate internationally recognized standards of corporate social responsibility in their practices and internal policies, such as statements of principle that have been endorsed or are supported by the Contracting Parties. These principles address issues such as labour, the environment, human rights, community relations and anti-corruption.</p>

        <div type="article" num="17" title="Taxation measures:">
          <p>1. Except as set out in this Article, this Agreement does not apply to a taxation measure.</p>
          <p>2. This Agreement does not affect the rights and obligations of a Contracting Party under a tax convention. In the event of inconsistency between this Agreement and a tax convention, that convention prevails.</p>
          <p>3. This Agreement does not require a Contracting Party to furnish or allow access to information, which if disclosed, would be contrary to the Contracting Party's law protecting information concerning the taxation affairs of a taxpayer.</p>
          <p>4. Subject to paragraph 2, the provisions of Articles 5 (National Treatment) and 6 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) apply to all taxation measures, other than those on income, capital gains or on the taxable capital of corporations, except that nothing in those Articles shall apply:</p>
          <p>(a) to a non-conforming provision of an existing taxation measure;</p>
          <p>(b) to the continuation or prompt renewal of a non-conforming provision of an existing taxation measure;</p>
          <p>(c) to an amendment to a non-conforming provision of an existing taxation measure to the extent that the amendment does not decrease its conformity at the time of the amendment with those Articles; or</p>
          <p>(d) to a new taxation measure that is aimed at ensuring the equitable and effective imposition or collection of taxes (including, for greater certainty, a measure that is taken by a Contracting Party to ensure compliance with the Contracting Party's taxation system or to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes) and that does not arbitrarily discriminate between persons, goods or services of the Contracting Parties.</p>
          <p>5. Provided that the conditions in paragraph 6 are met:</p>
          <p>(a) a claim by an investor that a taxation measure of a Contracting Party is in breach of an agreement between a national government authority of that Contracting Party and the investor concerning an investment shall be considered a claim for breach of this Agreement; and</p>
          <p>(b) the provisions of Article 11 (Expropriation) apply to taxation measures.</p>
          <p>6. An investor may not make a claim with respect to a matter covered under paragraph 5 unless:</p>
          <p>(a) the investor provides a copy of the notice of claim to the taxation authorities of the Contracting Parties; and</p>
          <p>(b) six months after receiving notification of the claim by the investor, the taxation authorities of the Contracting Parties fail to reach a joint determination that, in the case of subparagraph 5(a), the measure does not contravene that agreement, or in the case of subparagraph 5(b), the measure in question is not an expropriation.</p>
          <p>7. If, in connection with a claim by an investor of a Contracting Party or a dispute between the Contracting Parties, an issue arises as to whether a measure of a Contracting Party is a taxation measure, a Contracting Party may refer the issue to the taxation authorities of the Contracting Parties. A decision of the taxation authorities shall bind a Tribunal formed pursuant to Chapter III or special arbitral group formed pursuant to Chapter IV. A Tribunal or special arbitral group seized of a claim or a dispute in which the issue arises may not proceed until it receives the decision of the taxation authorities. If the taxation authorities have not decided the issue within six months of the referral, the Tribunal or special arbitral group shall decide the issue.</p>
          <p>8. Each Contracting Party shall notify the other Contracting Party by diplomatic note of the identity and of the coordinates of the taxation authorities referred to in this Article.</p>

          <p>1. The respondent Contracting Party shall deliver to the other Contracting Party a copy of the notice of intent to submit a claim to arbitration and of any other document within 30 days of the date those documents have been delivered to the respondent Contracting Party. The other Contracting Party is entitled, at its cost, to receive from the respondent Contracting Party a copy of the evidence that has been tendered to the Tribunal, copies of pleadings filed in the arbitration, and the written argument of the disputing parties. The Contracting Party receiving such information shall treat the information as if it were a respondent Contracting Party.</p>
          <p>2. The other Contracting Party has the right to attend hearings held under this Chapter. Upon written notice to the disputing parties, the other Contracting Party may make submissions to a Tribunal on questions of interpretation of this Agreement.</p>
