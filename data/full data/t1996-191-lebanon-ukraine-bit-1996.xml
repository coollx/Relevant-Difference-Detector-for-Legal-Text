      <p>Have agreed as follows:</p>
    </preamble>
    <body>
      <div type="article" num="1" title="Definitions">
        <p>For the purposes of this Agreement:</p>
        <p>1-&nbsp; The term "investor" refers with regard to either Contracting Party to:</p>
        <p>a) Natural persons who, according to the law of that Contracting Party, are considered to be its citizens;</p>
        <p>b) Legal entities, including companies, corporations, business associations and other organizations, which are constituted or otherwise duly organized under the law of that Contracting Party and have their seat in the territory of that same Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>The provisions of this sub-paragraph apply to holding or offshore Companies registered in any of the Contracting Parties. 2-&nbsp; The term "investments" shall include every kind of assets and particularly, but not exclusively:</p>
        <p>a) Movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem, such as mortgages, liens, and pledges;</p>
        <p>b) Shares in companies and other kinds of interest in companies;</p>
        <p>c) Intellectual property rights, such as copyrights, patents, industrial designs or models, trade or service marks, trade names, technical processes, know-how and goodwill, as well as other similar rights recognized by the laws of the Contracting Parties;</p>
        <p>d) Business concessions under public law, including concessions to search, extract or exploit natural resources as well as all other rights given by law, by contract or by decision of the authority in accordance with the law.</p>
        <p>Any alteration of the form in which assets are invested or reinvested shall not affect their character as investment. 3-&nbsp; The term "returns" means amounts yielded by an investment and in particular, though not exclusively, includes profits, dividends, interest, capital gains, royalties, management and technical assistance or other fees, irrespective of the form in which the return is paid.</p>
        <p>4-&nbsp; The term "territory" means the territory of the Contracting Parties, including the territorial sea and the economic exclusive zone as well as the continental shelf that extends outside the limits of the territorial waters over which the State concerned exercises, in accordance with internal and international law, sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion and Protection of Investments">
        <p>1-&nbsp; Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create favourable conditions for investors of the other Contracting Party to make investments in its territory and, shall admit such investments, in accordance with its laws and regulations.</p>
        <p>2-&nbsp; When a Contracting Party shall have admitted an investment on its territory, it shall, in accordance with its laws and regulations, grant the necessary permits in connection with such an investment, including authorizations for engaging top managerial and technical personnel of their choice, regardless of nationality</p>
        <p>3-&nbsp; Each Contracting Party shall protect within its territory investments made in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, sale or liquidation of such investments, In particular, each Contracting Party or its competent authorities shall issue the necessary authorizations mentioned in paragraph 2 of this Article.</p>

        <p>1-&nbsp; Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment within its territory of the investments and the investors of the other Contracting Party. This treatment shall not be less favourable than that granted by each Contracting Party to the investments made within its territory by its own investors, or than that granted by each Contracting Party to the investments made within its territory by investors of any third state, if this latter treatment is more favourable. However, in case of Lebanon this sub-paragraph does not apply to treatment granted to investors of countries members of the Arab League.</p>
        <p>2-&nbsp; The most favoured nation treatment shall not be construed so as to oblige a Contracting Party to extend to the investors and investments of the other Contracting Party the advantages resulting from any existing or future customs or economic union, a free trade area or regional economic organization, to which either of the Contracting Parties is or becomes a member. Nor shall such, treatment relate to any advantage which either Contracting Party accords to investors of a third state by virtue of a double taxation agreement or other agreements on a reciprocal basis regarding tax matters.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="Expropriation - Compensation">
        <p>1-&nbsp; Investments by investors of either Contracting Party shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>2-&nbsp; Neither of the Contracting Parties shall take, either directly or indirectly, measures of expropriation, nationalization or any other measures having the same nature or the same effect against investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, unless the measures are taken in the public interest as established by law, on a non-discriminatory basis, and under due process of law, and provided that provisions be made for effective and adequate compensation, according to the enforced national law without any kind of discrimination. Such compensation shall be equivalent to the value of the expropriated investment immediately before the date on which the actual or threatened expropriation, nationalization or comparable measure has become publicly known. The compensation shall be paid without delay and shall carry the usual bank interest until the time of payment; it shall be effectively realizable and freely transferable. Provisions shall have been made in an appropriate manner at or prior to the time of expropriation, nationalization or comparable measure for the determination and payment of such compensation. The legality of any such expropriation, nationalization or comparable measure and the amount of compensation shall be subject to review by due process of law.</p>
        <p>3-&nbsp; The provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article shall also apply where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is constituted under the laws in force in any part of its own territory and in which investors of the other Contracting Party own shares.</p>
        <p>4-&nbsp; Investors of either Contracting Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Contracting Party owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency, or revolt, shall be accorded treatment, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other valuable consideration, no less favourable than that which the latter Contracting Party accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State whichever is more favourable.

Both Contracting Parties should undertake to carry out the formalities required for the acquisition of foreign currency and for its effective transfer abroad within a period of three months. Moreover, the Contracting Parties should agree to accord to transfers referred to in the present Article a treatment no less favourable than that accorded to transfers originated from investments made by investors of any third state.</p>
