However, this Agreement shall not apply to disputes concerning an investment that have arisen before its entry into force.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Promotion and protection of investment">
        <p>1.  Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create favourable conditions for investors of the other Contracting Party to make investments in its territory, and admit such investments in accordance with its laws and policy.</p>

Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, shall include an additional daily rate of compensation at a fair and equitable commercial rate until the date of payment, shall be made without unreasonable delay, be effectively realizable and freely transferable. Where the market value cannot be ascertained properly, the compensation shall be determined in accordance with internationally recognised accounting principles.</p>

The investor affected shall have the right, under the law of the Contracting Party making the expropriation, to review, by a judicial or other independent authority of that Party, of his or its case and of the valuation of his or its investment in accordance with the principles set out in this paragraph.

Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its own territory, and in which investors of the other Contracting Party own shares, it shall ensure that the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article are applied to the extent necessary to ensure fair and equitable compensation in respect of their investment to such investors of the other Contracting Party who are owners of those shares.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Compensation for losses">
        <p>1.

        <p>Where one Contracting Party or its designated agency has guaranteed any indemnity against noncommercial risks in respect of an investment by any of its investors in the territory of the other Contracting Party and has made payment to such investors in respect of their claims under this Agreement, the other Contracting Party agrees that the first Contracting Party or its designated agency is entitled by virtue&#x201E; of subrogation to exercise the rights and assert the claims of those investors. The subrogated rights or claims shall not exceed the original rights or claims of such investors, and shall not lead to a double compensation.

Any such dispute which has not been amicably settled within a period of six months may, if both Parties agree, be submitted for resolution, in accordance with the law of the Contracting Party which has admitted the investment to that Contracting Party's competent judicial, arbitral or administrative bodies.</p>
        <p>3.  Should the Parties fail to agree on a dispute settlement procedure provided for under paragraph (2) of this Article or where a dispute is referred to conciliation but conciliation proceedings are terminated other than by signing of a settlement agreement, the dispute shall, upon the request of either party to the dispute, be referred to arbitration. The arbitration procedure shall be as follows:</p>
        <p>(a)  if the Contracting Party of the investor and the other Contracting Party are both parties to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, 1965 and the investor consents in writing to submit the dispute to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, such a dispute shall be referred to the Centre; or</p>

        <p>3.  Such an arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way. Within two months of the receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the tribunal. Those two members shall then select a national of a third Stale, with whom both Contracting Parties enjoy diplomatic relations and who on approval by the two Contracting Parties shall be appointed Chairman of the tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the second of the two members.</p>
        <p>4.  If within the periods specified in paragraph (3) of this Article, the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make any necessary</p>

        <p>5.  The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decisions shall be final and binding on both Contracting Parties. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings; the cost of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. The tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by ope, of the two Contracting Parties, and this award shall be final and binding on both Contracting Parties.

        <p>Each Contracting Party shall notify the other of the completion of the legal formalities required for the entry into force of this Agreement. This Agreement shall enter into force on the thirtieth (SO 01) day after the date of the latter of the two notifications.</p>
