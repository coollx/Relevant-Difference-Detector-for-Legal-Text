      <p>AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF MALTA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC RELATING TO ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND PROTECTION OF INVESTMENTS</p>
    </title>
    <preamble>
      <p>The Government of Malta and the Government of the Italian Republic, in their firm desire to intensify the friendly relations existing between the two States and their peoples through the establishment of closer economic cooperation have agreed as follows:</p>
    </preamble>
    <body>
      <div type="article" num="1">
        <p>The Contracting Parties shall cooperate in the development of their countries and to this end shall afford to each other to the extent that their legislation and resources permit such aid and facilities as may be necessary and possible in the economic field. On the basis and within the framework of this Agreement the Contracting Parties may conclude arrangements regarding individual projects of cooperation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2">
        <p>Where arrangements regarding individual projects of cooperation have been concluded in terms of Article 1, each Contracting Party shall grant to its nationals, foundations, associations or companies, on request, permission to invest in and to transfer capital, property, rights and interest for investment in the country of the other Party.</p>
        <p>Each Contracting Party shall grant to its nationals, foundations, associations and companies, on request, permission to supply goods on the basis of deferred payments to State and private enterprises in the country of the other Party in accordance with the legislation in force in the country of the Party granting the permission.</p>
        <p>Credits accruing from the said supply of goods may benefit from the guarantees contemplated by the laws in force in each of the two countries to the extent that such laws permit. The receiving country undertakes to authorise the transfer, in convertible currency, of each payment as it falls due to the creditor in the other country.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3">
        <p>The nationals, foundations, associations or companies of each Contracting Party, having effected capital investments in the territory of the other Party, in convertible currency, with the aim of setting up or expanding an enterprise for the production of goods and services, shall be entitled to transfer, in equally convertible currency and without delay or restriction of amount, the dividends and profits, the capitals deriving from the eventual extension of the original enterprise, as well as the income consisting of salaries or other earnings from professional activities connected with any investment effected in the territory of the other Party.</p>
        <p>As to the investments consisting in the supply of equipment for use in the enterprises defined in the first paragraph of this Article, the transfer of funds deriving from disinvestments will be allowed in convertible currency after a minimum delay of 2 years from the moment in which the investment has taken place.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4">
        <p>The investments, effected by the nationals, foundations, associations or companies of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other, and the profits thereof, shall not be subject to any expropriation except in the public interest, and then only against payment of a compensation equal to the value of the expropriated property. Such compensation shall be payable without delay, and shall be immediately transferable in convertible currency, without limitation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5">
        <p>The investments effected by the nationals, foundations, associations or companies of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other, shall be granted conditions not less favourable than those applying to nationals, foundations, associations or companies of any third country, with the exception of advantages deriving from agreements setting up a Customs Union, from membership of a Currency Bloc or from agreements to avoid double taxation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6">
        <p>Any controversy arising about the interpretation and the execution of the present Agreement shall be settled through the normal diplomatic channels. In case of failure to reach an understanding, the controversy in question shall be referred to the decision of a court of arbitration. The court shall consist of three members, two of which are nominated by each one of the Parties respectively, and the third shall be chosen by the two other members and shall be a national of a third country having no part in the dispute.</p>
        <p>If the two members fail to agree, the nomination of the third member shall be entrusted to the President of the International Court of Justice, or, in the case that the President is a national of one of the Contracting Parties or is for any other reason prevented from proceeding, to the vice-president.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7">
        <p>The present Agreement shall become operative on the notification of each Contracting Party to the other that the constitutional prescriptions for its conclusion and entering into force have been complied with. It shall remain operative until six months from the date of a notice of denunciation by one of the Parties.</p>
        <p>The termination of the present Agreement shall not invalidate contracts already concluded and guarantees already furnished within the framework of this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
    </body>
