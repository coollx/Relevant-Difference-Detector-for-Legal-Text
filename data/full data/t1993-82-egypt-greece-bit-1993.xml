        <p>2 . Investments by investors of a Contracting Party shall, at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.

        <p>1 .

        <p>a) The measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law,</p>
        <p>b) The measures are clear and not discriminatory, and</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Compensation for losses">
        <p>Investors of one Contracting Party whose investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party suffer losses owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency or other exceptional situations in the territory of the latter Contracting Party shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party treatment, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement, no less favourable than that which the latter Contracting Party accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable. Resulting payments shall be made without delay and be freely transferable in convertible currency.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Repatriation of investment and returns">

        <p>Where one Contracting Party or its designated Agency has issued any financial guarantee against non-commercial risks in regard to an investment by an investor in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter shall recognize the rights of the first Contracting Party or its designated Agency by virtue of the principle of subrogation to the rights of the investor when payment has been made under this guarantee by the first Contracting Party or its designated Agency. The other Contracting Party shall be entitled to set off taxes and other public charges due and payable by the investor.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Application">
        <p>This Agreement shall apply to investments made both prior to and after its entry into force by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the latter's legislation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1 . Any dispute between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall, if possible, be settled through diplomatic channels.</p>
        <p>2 . If the dispute cannot thus be settled within six months from the beginning of the negotiations, it shall upon the request of either Contracting Party be submitted to an arbitration tribunal.</p>
        <p>3 . The arbitration tribunal shall be constituted ad hoc as follows. Each Contracting Party shall appoint one arbitrator and these two arbitrators shall agree upon a national of a third State as chairman. The arbitrators shall be appointed within three months, the chairman within five months from the date on which either Contracting Party has informed the other Contracting Party that it intends to submit the dispute to an arbitration tribunal.</p>
        <p>4 . If within the periods specified in paragraph 3 of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, any Party to the dispute may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make any necessary appointments. If the President of the Court is a national of any Party to this dispute or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President or if he is a national of any Party or is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Member of the Court next in seniority who is not a national of any Party to the dispute shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5 . The arbitration tribunal shall decide on the basis of respect for the law, including particularly the present Agreement and other relevant agreements existing between the two Contracting Parties and the generally acknowledged rules and principles of International law.</p>
        <p>6 . Unless the Parties decide otherwise, the tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
        <p>7 . The tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be final and binding on the Parties.</p>
        <p>8 . Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of the arbitrator appointed by itself and of its representation. The cost of the chairman as well as the other costs will be born in equal parts by the Contracting Parties.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Settlement of disputes between an investor and a contracting party">
        <p>1 . Disputes between an investor of a Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the latter under this Agreement, in relation to an investment of the former shall, as far as possible be settled by the disputing parties in an amicable way.</p>
        <p>2 . If such disputes cannot be settled within six months from the date either party requested amicable settlement, the investor concerned may submit the dispute either to the competent court of the Contracting Party, or to an international arbitration tribunal. Each Contracting Party herewith declares its acceptance of such an arbitration procedure. In the latter case, the provisions of article 9, par. 3&#x2013;8 shall be applied mutatis mutandis. Nevertheless the President of the Court of the International Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris shall be invited to make the necessary appointments whereas the arbitration tribunal shall determine its procedure by applying the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, as then in force. The award shall be binding and enforced in accordance with domestic law.</p>
        <p>3 . During arbitration or the enforcement of an award, the Contracting Party involved in the dispute shall not raise the objection that the investor of the other Contracting Party has received compensation under an insurance contract in respect of all or part of the damage.</p>
        <p>4 . In case both Contracting Parties have become members of the Convention of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of the Other States, disputes between either Contracting Party and the investor of the other Contracting Party under the first paragraph of this Article may, at the request of the investor concerned, be submitted for settlement by conciliation or arbitration to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Application of other rules">
        <p>If the provisions of law of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement contain a regulation, whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by the present Agreement, such regulation shall, to the extent that it is more favourable, prevail over the present Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="12" title="Consultations">
        <p>Representatives of the Contracting Parties shall, whenever necessary, hold consultations on any matter affecting the implementation of this Agreement. These consultations shall be held on the proposal of one of the Contracting Parties at a place and at a time agreed upon through diplomatic channels.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="13" title="Entry into force, duration, termination">
        <p>1 . Each Contracting Party shall notify the other Contracting Party of the completion of the internal procedures required for bringing this Agreement into force on the date of the latter notification.</p>
        <p>2 . This Agreement shall remain in force for a period of ten years. Thereafter it shall remain in force for an indefinite period unless either Contracting Party notifies in writing to the other Contracting Party its intention to terminate it. The notice of termination of this Agreement shall become effective one year after it has been received by the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>3 . In respect of investments made prior to the date of the termination of this Agreement the foregoing Articles shall continue to be effective for a further period of twenty years from that date.</p>
        <p>4 . Upon its entry into force, this Agreement shall replace the Agreement between the Hellenic Republic and the Arab Republic of Egypt concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, signed in Cairo on 1 April 1975.</p>
