        <div type="article" num="6" title="Most-favoured-nation treatment">
          <p>1.

          <p>2. The following rules apply to the aforementioned procedure:</p>
          <p>a) To initiate the procedure, the interested Party shall submit a written request to the other Party, identifying the specific measure in question, and presenting the relevant allegations of fact and law. The Joint Committee shall meet within sixty (60) days from the date of the request;</p>
          <p>b) The Joint Committee shall have sixty (60) days from the date of the first meeting, extendable by mutual agreement, to evaluate the submission presented and to prepare a report;</p>
          <p>c) The report of the Joint Committee shall include the:</p>
          <p>(i) Identification of the submitting Party;</p>
          <p>(ii) Description of the measure in question and the alleged breach of the Agreement; and</p>
          <p>(iii) Findings of the Joint Committee.</p>
          <p>d) In the event that the dispute is not resolved upon the completion of the time frames set forth in this Article, or there is non-participation of a Party in the meetings of the Joint Committee convened according to this Article, the dispute may be submitted to arbitration by a Party in accordance with Article 25 of this Agreement.</p>

          <p>a) The initial submission shall identify the affected investor; and</p>
          <p>b) Representatives of the affected investor may be invited to appear before the Joint Committee.</p>

        </div>
        <div type="article" num="25" title="Settlement of disputes between the parties">
          <p>1. Once the procedure under paragraph 3 of Article 24 has been exhausted and the dispute has not been resolved, either Party may submit the dispute to an ad hoc Arbitral Tribunal, in accordance with the provisions of this Article. Alternatively, the Parties may choose, by mutual agreement, to submit the dispute to a permanent arbitration institution for settlement of investment disputes. Unless the Parties decide otherwise, such institution shall apply the provisions of this Article.</p>
          <p>2. The purpose of the arbitration is to determine the conformity with this Agreement of a measure that a Party claims to be not in conformity with the Agreement.</p>
          <p>3. The following may not be subject to arbitration: Article 13 - Security Exceptions; Article 14 - Domestic Legislation; Article 15- Corporate Social Responsibility; paragraph 1 of Article 16-lnvestment Measures and Combating Corruption and Illegality; and paragraph 2 of Article 17- Provisions on Investment and Environment, Labor Affairs and Health.</p>
          <p>4. This Article shall not apply to any dispute concerning any facts which have occurred, nor any measures which have been adopted before the entry into force of this Agreement.</p>
          <p>5. This Article shall not apply to any dispute if more than five (5) years have elapsed since the date on which the Party knew or should have known ofthe facts giving rise to the dispute.</p>
          <p>6. The Arbitral Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators. Each Party shall appoint, within three (3) months after receiving the "notice of arbitration", a member of the Arbitral Tribunal. Within three (3) months of the appointment of the second arbitrator, the two members shall appoint a national of a third State with which both Parties maintain diplomatic relations, who, upon approval by both Parties, shall be appointed chairperson of the Arbitral Tribunal. The appointment of the Chairperson must be approved by both Parties within one (1) month from the date of his/her nomination.</p>
          <p>7. If, within the periods specified in paragraph 6 of this Article, the necessary appointments are not concluded, either Party may invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President of the International Court of Justice is a national of one Party or is prevented from fulfilling said function, the member of the International Court of Justice who has the most seniority who is not a national of a Party will be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
          <p>8. Arbitrators must:</p>
          <p>a) Have the necessary experience or expertise in Public International Law, international investment rules or international trade, or the resolution of disputes arising in relation to international investment agreements;</p>
          <p>b) Be independent of and not be affiliated, directly or indirectly, with any of the Parties or with the other arbitrators or potential witnesses nor take instructions from the Parties; and</p>
          <p>c) Comply with the "Rules of conduct for the understanding on rules and procedures governing the settlement of disputes " of the World Trade Organization (WTO/DSB/RC/1, dated December 11 1996), as applicable to the dispute, or any other standard of conduct established by the Joint Committee.</p>
          <p>9. The "Notice of Arbitration" and other documents relating to the resolution of the dispute shall be presented at the location designated by each Party.</p>
          <p>10. The Arbitral Tribunal shall determine its own procedures, in consultation with the Parties, in accordance with this Article and, subsidiarity, to the extent that it is not inconsistent with this Agreement, with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) in force on the date of entry into force of this Agreement. The Arbitral Tribunal will render its decision by majority vote and decide on the basis of the provisions of this Agreement and the applicable principles and rules of international law as recognized by both Parties. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal shall be rendered within nine (9) months, extendable for ninety (90) days, following the appointment of the Chairperson in accordance with paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Article.</p>
          <p>11. The decision of the Arbitral Tribunal shall be final and binding to the Parties, who shall comply with it without delay.</p>
          <p>12. The Joint Committee shall approve the general rule for determining the arbitrators' fees, taking into account the practices of relevant international organizations. The Parties shall bear the expenses of the arbitrators as well as other costs of the proceedings equally, unless otherwise agreed.</p>
          <p>13. Notwithstanding paragraph 2 of this Article, the Parties may, through a specific arbitration agreement, request the arbitrators to examine the existence of damages caused by the measure in question under this Agreement and to establish compensation for such damages through an arbitration award. In this case, in addition to the provisions of the preceding paragraphs of this Article, the following shall be observed:</p>
          <p>a) The arbitration agreement to examine the existence of damages shall be taken as "notice of arbitration" within the meaning of paragraph 6 of this Article;</p>
          <p>b) This paragraph shall not be applied to a dispute concerning a particular investor which has been previously resolved and where protection of res judicata applies. If an investor had submitted claims regarding the measure at issue in the Joint Committee to local courts or an arbitration tribunal of the Host State, the arbitration to examine damages can only be initiated after the withdrawal of such claims by the investor in local courts or an arbitration tribunal of the Host State. If after the establishment of the arbitration, the existence of claims in local courts or arbitral tribunals over the contested measure is made known to the arbitrators or the Parties, the arbitration will be suspended.</p>
          <p>c) If the arbitration award provides monetary compensation, the Party receiving such compensation shall transfer to the holders of the rights of the investment in question, after deducting the costs of the dispute in accordance with the internal procedures of each Party. The Party to whom restitution was granted may request the Arbitral Tribunal to order the transfer of the compensation directly to the holders of rights of the affected investment and the payment of costs to whoever has assumed them.</p>
