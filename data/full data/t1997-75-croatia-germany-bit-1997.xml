          <p>With reference to the Treaty of 21 March 1997 between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Croatia on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Capital Investments, I have the honor to propose to you the conclusion of an agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Croatia on the editorial amendment of the German text of the Treaty, which shall have the following wording:</p>
          <p>(1) As a result of an editorial error, the German and Croatian texts of Article 13(1) of the above-mentioned Treaty differ. Therefore, in order to establish congruent textual versions, it is proposed to correct the German wording of Article 13(1) as follows:</p>
          <p>"Article 13</p>
          <p>(1) This Treaty shall be subject to ratification; the instruments of ratification shall be exchanged as soon as possible."</p>

          <p>(3) This Agreement shall be concluded in the German and Croatian languages, each text being equally authentic.</p>
          <p>If the Republic of Croatia agrees with the proposals made in paragraphs 1 to 3 above, this Note and Your Excellency's Note in reply expressing the agreement of the Republic of Croatia shall constitute an agreement between our two States which shall enter into force together with the Treaty of 21 March 1997 between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Croatia on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Capital Investments.</p>
