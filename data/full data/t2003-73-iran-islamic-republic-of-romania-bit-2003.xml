      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Settlement of disputes between a contracting party and investors of the other contracting party">
        <p>1.  If any dispute arises between the host Contracting Party and investors of the other Contracting Party with respect to an investment, the host Contracting Party and the investors shall primarily endeavour to settle the dispute in an amicable manner through negociation and consultation.</p>
        <p>2.  In the event that such dispute cannot be settled as provided in paragraph 1 of this Article within six months from the date of the written application for settlement, the investor in question may submit at his choice the dispute for settlement to:</p>
        <p>a)  the competent court of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment has been made;</p>

        <p>1.  Any dispute which may arise between the Contracting Parties relating to the interpretation and application of this Agreement shall, as far as possible, be settled through consultations and negotiations.</p>

In the event that the dispute cannot be settled within six months from the date on which one of the Contracting Parties notifies in writing the other Contracting Party, the dispute shall, at the request of one of the Contracting Parties and with due regard to its national laws and regulations, be laid before an ad hoc Arbitration Tribunal as provided in this Article.</p>

If, within the periods specified in paragraph 3 of this Article, the appointments have not been made, each of the two Contracting Parties can, in the absence of any other arrangement, ask the President of the International Court of Justice to make the appointment. In the event that the President of the International Court is a citizen or national of the State of one of the Contracting Parties or, if for any reason, it is impossible for him to make the appointment, the application shall be made to the Vice President of the Court. If the Vice President of the Court is a citizen or national of the State of one of the Contracting Parties, or is unable to make the appointment for any reason, the most senior member of the International Court of Justice, who is not a citizen or national of the State of one of the Contracting Parties, shall be invited to make the appointment.</p>
        <p>5.  Both Contracting Parties shall pay the costs of their own arbitration and of their representative at the hearings. The costs of the Chairman and any other costs shall be divided equally between the Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>6.  The Arbitration Tribunal shall lay down its own procedures and determine the place of arbitration.</p>
        <p>7.  The Arbitration Tribunal shall rule with a majority vote and its decisions shall be final and binding on the Contracting Parties.</p>
