      <div type="article" num="4" title="National and most favoured nation treatment">
        <p>1.

        <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall accord in its territory to the investors of the other Contracting Party with regard to acquisition, operation, development, management, maintenance, use, expansion, sale or other disposal of their investment, a treatment which is no less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the investors concerned.</p>
        <p>3. The most favoured nation treatment shall apply to the pre-establishment to extent it is done in accordance with the laws and regulations of a Contracting Party relating to the establishment or acquisition of investment and being addmitted accordingly.</p>

        <p>6.

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Compensation for damage or loss">

        <p>2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1 of this Article, investors of one Contracting Party who in any of the events referred to in that paragraph suffer damage or loss in the territory of the other Contracting Party resulting from:</p>

        <p>Resulting payments shall be made in freely convertible currency and be freely transferable without delay.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Expropriation">
        <p>A Contracting Party shall not expropriate or nationalise directly or indirectly in its territory an investment of an investor of the other Contracting Party or take any measures having equivalent effect (hereinafter referred to as "expropriation'") except if the following conditions occur simultaneously:</p>
        <p>a. for a purpose which is in the public interest,</p>
        <p>b. on a non-discriminatory basis,</p>
        <p>c. in accordance with due process of law, and</p>
        <p>d. accompanied by payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.</p>

        <p>5. An investor of a Contracting Party affected by the expropriation carried out by the other Contracting Party shall have the right to prompt review of its case, including the valuation of its investment and the payment of compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Article, by a judicial authority or another competent and independent authority of the latter Contracting Party.</p>

        <p>b. that the guarantor is entitled to exercise such rights and enforce such claims by virtue of subrogation, to the same extent as the party indemnified, and shall assume the obligations related to the investment.</p>
        <p>3. The guarantor shall be entitled in all circumstances to:</p>
        <p>a. the same treatment in respect of the rights, claims and obligations acquired by it, by virtue of the assignment; and</p>

        <p>3. The subrogated rights or claims shall not exceed the original rights or claims of the investor.</p>
        <p>4. Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, subrogation shall take place in the Contracting Party only after the approval of the competent authority of that Contracting Party, if such approval is required.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Settlement of disputes between a contracting party and an investor of the other contracting party">
        <p>1. An investor that has a dispute with a Contracting Party should initially attempt to settle it amicably through negotiations.</p>
        <p>2. To start negotiations, the investor shall deliver to the Contracting Party a written notice. The notice shall specify:</p>
        <p>a. the name and address of the disputing investor;</p>
        <p>b. the provisions of this Agreement alleged to have been breached;</p>
        <p>c. the factual and legal basis for the claim; and</p>
        <p>d. the remedy sought and the amount of damages claimed.</p>
        <p>3. When required by the Contracting Party, if the dispute cannot be settled amicably within six months from the moment of receipt of the written notice, it shall be submitted to the competent authorities of that Contracting Party or arbitration centers thereof, for conciliation.</p>
        <p>4. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably within six months from the moment of receipt of the written notice or from the start of the conciliation referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, the dispute shall upon the request of the investor be settled as follows:</p>
        <p>a. by a competent court of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made; or</p>
        <p>b. by arbitration by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, opened for signature in Washington on 18th March 1965. In case of arbitration, each Contracting Party, by this Agreement irrevocably consents in advance, even in the absence of an individual arbitral agreement between the Contracting Party and the investor, to submit any such dispute to this Centre. This consent implies the renunciation of the requirement that the internal administrative or judicial remedies should be exhausted; or</p>
        <p>c. by arbitration by three arbitrators in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), as amended by the last amendment accepted by both Contracting Parties. In case of arbitration, each Contracting Party, by this Agreement irrevocably consents in advance, even in the absence of an individual arbitral agreement between the Contracting Party and the investor, to submit any such dispute to the tribunal mentioned.</p>
        <p>5. The award shall be final and binding. Each Contracting Party shall ensure the recognition and enforcement of the arbitral award in accordance with its laws and regulations.</p>
        <p>6.

        <p>7. When the investor and any designated entity of a Contracting Party or its local government have concluded an agreement concerning the investments of the investor, the dispute settlement procedure stipulated therein shall apply.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Settlement of disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1. Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be settled as far as possible by negotiations.</p>
        <p>2. If a dispute under paragraph 1 of this Article cannot be settled within six months it shall upon the request of either Contracting Party be submitted to an arbitral tribunal of three members.</p>
        <p>3. Such arbitral tribunal shall be constituted ad hoc. Each Contracting Party shall appoint one member and these two members shall agree upon a national of a third State as their chairman. Such members shall be appointed within two months from the date one Contracting Party has informed the other Contracting Party of its intention to submit the dispute to an arbitral tribunal, the chairman of which shall be appointed within two further months.</p>
        <p>4. If the periods specified in paragraph 3 of this Article are not observed, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other relevant arrangement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President of the International Court of Justice is a national of either of the Contracting Parties or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-president or in case of his inability the member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority according to the Rules of the Court should be invited under the same conditions to make the necessary appointments. The appointed judge should be a national of a State that has diplomatic relations with the Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>5. The arbitral tribunal shall establish its own rules of procedure unless the Contracting Parties decide otherwise.</p>
        <p>6. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision in virtue of this Agreement and pursuant to the tules of international law. It shall reach its decision by a majority of votes; the decision shall be final and binding.</p>
        <p>7. Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of its own member and of its legal representation in the arbitration proceedings. The costs of the chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by both Contracting Parties. The tribunal may, however, in its award determine another distribution of costs.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Application of other rules">
        <p>Without prejudice to Article 4, if the legislation of either Contracting Party or obligations between the Contracting Parties under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties, in addition to this Agreement, contain rules whether general or specific, entitling investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by this Agreement, such rules shall to the extent that they are more favourable to the investor, prevail over this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="12" title="Application of the agreement">
        <p>This Agreement shall apply to investments made prior to or after the entry into force of this Agreement, but shall not apply to any investment dispute that may have arisen nor any claim that was settled before its entry into force.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="13" title="Consultations">
        <p>The Contracting Parties shall, on the request of either, hold consultations on any matter relating to the implementation or application of this Agreement. These consultations shall be held on the proposal of one of the Contracting Parties at a place and a time to be agreed upon through diplomatic channels.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="14" title="Limitation of benefits">
        <p>1. Benefits of this Agreement shall not be available to an investor of a Contracting Party, if the main purpose of the acquisition of the nationality of that Contracting Party was to obtain benefits under this Agreement that would not otherwise be available to the investor.</p>
        <p>2. Prior to denying the benefits of this Agreement, the denying Contracting Party shall notify the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="15" title="Entry into force, amendments, duration and termination">
        <p>1. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of receipt of the latter notification through diplomatic channels by which either Contracting Party notifies the other Contracting Party that its internal legal requirements for the entry into force of this Agreement have been fulfilled.</p>
        <p>2. This Agreement may be amended in writing by the mutual consent of the Contracting Parties. Such amendments shall enter into force according to the same procedure as the Agreement.</p>
        <p>3. This Agreement shall remain in force for a period of ten years and shall be extended thereafter for following ten years periods unless, one year before the expiration of the initial or any subsequent period, either Contracting Party notifies the other Contracting Party of its intention to terminate the Agreement. In that case, the termination shall become effective by the expiration of current period of ten years.</p>
        <p>4. In respect of investments made prior to the date when the termination of this Agreement becomes effective, the provisions of this Agreement shall continue to be effective for a period of ten years from the date the termination of this Agreement became effective.</p>
        <p>5. This Agreement shall apply irrespective of the existence of diplomatic or consular relations between the Contracting Parties.</p>
