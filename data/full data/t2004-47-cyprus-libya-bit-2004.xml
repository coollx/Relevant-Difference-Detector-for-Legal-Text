        <p>For the purpose of implementing this Agreement,</p>
        <p>1.  Each Contracting Party shall encourage investments and create favourable conditions for investors of the other Contracting Party to make investments in its territory and shall admit such investments in accordance with its laws and regulations.</p>
        <p>2.  Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security according to the law.

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="National treatment and most favoured nation treatment">
        <p>1.  Once a Contracting Party has admitted an investment in its territory in accordance with its laws and regulations, it shall accord to such investment made by testers of the other Contracting Party treatment not less favourable than that accorded to investments of its own investors or of investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the investor concerned.</p>
        <p>2.  Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investors of the other Contracting Party, as regards to their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, expansion or disposal of their investment, treatment not less favourable than that accorded to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the investors concerned.</p>
        <p>3.  The treatment granted under this Article shall not be construted so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to the investors of the other Contracting Party and their investments the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from:</p>

If the legislation of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to this Agreement contain a regulation, whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than that provided for by this Agreement, such regulation shall, to the extent that it is more favourable, prevail over this Agreement.</p>
        <p>2.  More favourable terms than those of this Agreement which have been agreed to by one of the Contracting Parties with investors of the other Contracting Party shall not be affected by this Agreement.</p>
      </div>

Resulting payments shall be freely transferable.</p>
        <p>2.  Notwithstanding paragraph 1, an investor of one Contracting Party who, in any of the situations referred to in that paragraph, suffers a loss in the territory of the other Contracting Party resulting from</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Freedom of transfers">

      <div type="article" num="7" title="Expropriation">
        <p>1.  Investments of investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated or subjected to measures having equivalent effect to nationalization or expropriation, except for public interest, in accordance with due process of law, on a non-discriminatory basis and against the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.</p>
        <p>2.  Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or impending expropriation became publicly known, whichever is the earlier (hereinafter referred to as the "valuation date").</p>
        <p>3.  Such market value shall be calculated in a freely convertible currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing for that currency on the valuation date. Compensation shall include interest calculated on the basis of the 6-month LIBOR rate applicable on the date of expropriation, from the date of expropriation until the date of payment. Compensation shall be paid without delay, be effectively realizable and freely transferable.</p>

        <p>If one Contracting Party or its designated Agency makes a payment under an indemnity, guarantee or contract of insurance against non-commercial risks given in respect of an investment made by any of its investors in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall recognize the assignment of any right or claim of such investor to the former Contracting Party or its designated Agency and the right of the former Contracting Party or its designated Agency to exercise, by virtue of subrogation, any such right and claim to the same extent as its predecessor in title. This subrogation will make it possible for the former Contracting Party or its designated Agency to be the direct beneficiary of any payment for indemnification or other compensation to which the investor could be entitled.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Settlement of disputes between one of the contracting parties and investors of the other party">
