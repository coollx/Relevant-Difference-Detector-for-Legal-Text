Such compensation shall be at least equal to the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, shall include interest at a normal commercial rate until the date of payment, shall be made without delay, and shall be effectively realisable.</p>
        <p>(2) The investor affected by the expropriation shall have a right, under the domestic law of the country of the Party making the expropriation, to prompt review, by a court of law or other independent and impartial forum of that Party, of his or its case and of the valuation of his or its investment in accordance with the principles referred to in sub-Article (1).</p>

        <p>(2) If the dispute has not been settled within six (6) months from the date at which it was raised in writing, the dispute may at the choice of the investor, after notifying the Party concerned of its intention to do so in writing, be submitted -</p>
        <p>(a) To the competent courts of the Party in whose territory the investment is made;</p>
        <p>(b) To arbitration by the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington DC on 18 March 1965; or</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Disputes between the Parties">
