        <p>3  &#x2014; Such an arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way: within three months from the receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the tribunal.

        <p>2  &#x2014; If such disputes cannot be settled within six months from the date either party requested amicable settlement, the investor concerned may submit the dispute to the competent court of the Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>3  &#x2014; In case of disputes with regard to articles 4 and 5 of this Agreement the investor concerned may choose, instead, to submit the dispute for settlement by arbitration to:</p>

      <p>1&#x2014;. With reference to article 2 of this Agreement</p>
      <p>The provisions of article 2 of this Agreement shall also be applicable when investors of one of the Contracting Parties are already established in the territory of the other Contracting Party and wish to extend their activities or to carry out activities in other sectors.</p>
      <p>2&#x2014;. With reference to article 3 of this Agreement</p>
      <p>Such investments shall be considered as new ones and, to that extent, shall be made in accordance with the rules that regulate the admission of investments, according to article 2 of this Agreement.</p>
      <p>The Contracting Parties consider that provisions of article 3 of this Agreement are not in prejudice of the right of either Contracting Party to apply the pertinent provisions of their national legislation on taxes, if such legislation makes a distinction between tax-payers whose situation is not identical namely with regard to their place of residence or the place where the capital is invested.</p>
