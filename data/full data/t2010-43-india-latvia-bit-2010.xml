        <b>Protocol </b>
      </p>
      <p>To the Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the Republic of Latvia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments</p>
      <p>On the signing of the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the Republic of Latvia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, the undersigned representatives have agreed on the following provisions which constitute an integral part of the Agreement:</p>
      <div type="article" title="Ad Article 1">
        <p>The Republic of India takes note of the statement of the Republic of Latvia that the term "non-citizens" referred to in Article 1, paragraph (b)(i), means a person who, in accordance with the Law on Status of Those Former U.S.S.R. Citizens Who Do Not Have Citizenship Of Latvia Or That of any Other State, has a right to a non-citizen passport issued by the Republic of Latvia.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" title="Ad Article 5">
        <p>1. Article 5 (Expropriation) is intended to reflect customary international law concerning the obligation of States with respect to expropriation.</p>
        <p>2. An action or a series of actions by a Contracting Party cannot constitute an expropriation unless it interferes with a tangible or intangible property right or property interest in an investment.</p>
        <p>3. Article 5 addresses two situations. The first is direct expropriation, where an investment is nationalized or otherwise directly expropriated through formal transfer of title or outright seizure.</p>
        <p>4. The second situation addressed by Article 5 is indirect expropriation, where an action or series of actions by a Contracting Party has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.</p>
        <p>(a) The determination of whether an action or series of action, in a specific fact situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact based inquiry that considers, among other factors: the economic impact of the governmental action, although the fact that an action or series of actions by a Contracting Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred; the extent to which the government action interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; and the character of the government action.(i) The economic impact of the governmental action, although the fact that an action or series of actions by a Contracting Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred;</p>
        <p>(ii) The extent to which the government action interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; and</p>
        <p>(iii) The character of the government action.</p>
        <p>(b) Actions by a Government or Government controlled bodies, taken as a part of normal business activities, will not constitute indirect expropriation unless it is prima facie apparent that it was taken with an intent to create an adverse impact on the economic value of an investment.</p>
        <p>(c) Except in rare circumstances, non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a Contracting Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health, safety, and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriation.</p>
        <p>For the Government of the Republic of India                                                     For the Government of the Republic of Latvia</p>
        <p>Sd/-                           (Anand Sharma)                           Minister of Commerce and Industry                          Sd/-</p>
