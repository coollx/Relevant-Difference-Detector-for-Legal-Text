        <p>1. Investors of one Contracting Party who suffer losses relating to their investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party due to war, a state of national emergency, insurrection, riot or other similar events, shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party, treatment no less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable.</p>
        <p>2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, investors of one Contracting Party who suffer losses in the territory of the other Contracting Party resulting from:</p>
        <p>a) Requisitioning of their investments or part thereof by the latter's forces or authorities, or</p>
        <p>b) Destruction of their investment or part thereof by the latter's forces or authorities, which was not required by the necessity of the situation,</p>

      <div type="article" num="8" title="Settlement of Investment Disputes">
        <p>1.

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Settlement of Disputes between the Contracting Parties">
        <p>1. Any dispute between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall, as far as possible, be settled by negotiations through the diplomatic channels.</p>
        <p>2. If the Contracting Parties cannot reach an agreement within six months after the beginning of the dispute, the latter shall, upon the request of either Contracting Party, be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>3. Such an arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each case in the following way.

The third arbitrator, once approved by the two Contracting Parties, shall be appointed as Chairman of the arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>4. If the arbitral tribunal has not been constituted within the periods specified in paragraph 3 of this Article, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make any necessary appointments. If the President is a national of State of either Contracting Party, or is otherwise prevented from discharging this function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of State of either Contracting Party or if he also is prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of State of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5. The arbitral tribunal shall determine its own procedure. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decisions by a majority of votes. The decisions shall be final and binding upon each Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>6. Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of its own member of the arbitral tribunal and of its representation in the arbitration proceedings; the costs of the Chairman and remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. The arbitral tribunal may, however, decide that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the two Contracting Parties and such award shall be binding on both Contracting Parties.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="More Favourable Provisions">
        <p>If the provisions of laws and regulations of either Contracting Party or international law entitle investors of the other Contracting Party or their investments to treatment more favourable than is provided for by this Agreement, such provisions shall to the extent that they are more favourable prevail over this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Consultations">
        <p>Upon request by either Contracting Party, the other Contracting Party shall agree promptly to hold consultation on the interpretation or application of this Agreement.</p>
