      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Exceptions">
        <p>The provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of this Agreement shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to the investors of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege which may be extended by the former Contracting Party by virtue of:</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Settlement of investment disputes between a contracting party and an investor of the other contracting party">
        <p>(1) Any dispute between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party including expropriation or nationalization of an investment shall, as far as possible, be settled by the parties to the dispute in an amicable way.</p>
        <p>(2) The local remedies under the laws and regulations of one Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment has been made are available for the investors of the other Contracting Party on the basis of treatment not less favourable than that accorded to investments of its own investors or investors of any third State, whichever is the more favourable to the investor.</p>
        <p>(3) If the dispute cannot thus be settled within six(6) months from the date on which the dispute has been raised by either party to the dispute, it shall be submitted upon request of either the investor or the Contracting Party to:</p>
        <p>(a) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), established by the Washington Convention of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, if both of the Contracting Parties are Parties to members of this Convention; or</p>

        <p>(3) The Arbitral Tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way. Within two(2) months of the receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the Tribunal.
