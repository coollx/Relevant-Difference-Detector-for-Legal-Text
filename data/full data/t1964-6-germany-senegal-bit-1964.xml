        <p>(1) The Contracting Parties shall enter into negotiations as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Treaty for the conclusion of a Treaty of Establishment which shall regulate matters relating to the following matters entry and exit, temporary and permanent residence, protection against expulsion, admission to and exercise of economic and professional activities, establishment of enterprises without capital limitation and participation in such enterprises, work authorization for managerial and technical personnel, protection and security of person and property, free access to courts of law, freedom to conclude contracts, acquisition of real estate and other property, admission to the establishment of arbitration.</p>
        <p>(2) Ad Article 1</p>
        <p>(a) Each Contracting Party may, in accordance with its legal and regulatory provisions, decide, within the framework of Article 1, whether it will grant the necessary authorizations.</p>
        <p>(b) As long as the legal or regulatory provisions of a Contracting Party require, in the case of capital investments of foreign nationals or companies, an approval or admission procedure, the provisions of this Treaty shall apply to a particular capital investment only after notification by the above-mentioned Contracting Party to the other Contracting Party that the relevant approval or admission procedure has been completed. At the time of notification, such capital investment shall enjoy the full protection of this Treaty.</p>
        <p>(3) Ad Article 2</p>
        <p>(a) (aa) "Less favourable conditions" within the meaning of Article 2 shall include: restrictions on the acquisition of raw and auxiliary materials, motive power, and fuels, as well as of means of production and operation of any kind, any impediment to the sale of products within the country and abroad, and any other measures having similar effects.</p>
        <p>bb) On the other hand, measures taken for reasons of public safety, health, order or morality, the intervention of which would prove necessary, are not considered as "less favorable conditions" within the meaning of Article 2.</p>
        <p>(cc) It is understood that measures of a contracting party aimed at the functional reorganization of particular sectors of the national economy shall not be considered as "less favorable conditions" within the meaning of Article 2, provided that such measures are applied equally to its own nationals and companies and to the nationals and companies of Third States.</p>
        <p>(b) Article 2 shall not apply to entry, stay and employment as an employee.</p>
        <p>(c) Each Contracting Party may, in the interest of its national economy and in connection with the approval or admission of a capital investment by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, agree with such nationals or companies in the act of approval or admission to special conditions concerning</p>
        <p>(aa) the administration of the capital investment,</p>

        <p>(4) Ad Article 3</p>
        <p>(a) The provisions of the second paragraph of Article 3 shall also apply to the transfer of a capital investment into public ownership, to its placing under public control or to similar interventions by the State. Expropriation means the withdrawal or limitation of any property right constituting a capital investment, alone or in conjunction with other rights.</p>
        <p>(b) It is understood that the application of national legislation on law enforcement and taxation does not constitute expropriation within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 3.</p>

        <p>(a) In the Republic of Senegal, the free transfer of capital shall be guaranteed only to investments whose contribution to the economic development of the country has been previously recognized by a special act of approval. Consequently, the provisions of Article 4 shall not be applied to capital investments made by German nationals and companies until the guarantee of free transfer has been communicated in the notification provided for in paragraph b) of number 2 of this Protocol. The above provisions do not preclude possible agreements on transfer commitments for investments other than those referred to above.</p>
        <p>(b) Any disposal carried out with a view to relinquishing all or part of the investment shall also be considered as "liquidation" within the meaning of Article 4. </p>
        <p>(6) Ad Article 6</p>
        <p>Any transfer that takes place within the time period normally required for the completion of the transfer formalities shall be considered to be effected "without undue delay" within the meaning of the first paragraph of Article 6. The period shall begin to run from the date of submission of the request for transfer together with a file containing all the necessary supporting documents and shall not exceed two months.</p>
        <p>(7) Ad Article 8</p>
        <p>(a) As long as a Contracting Party uses the procedure provided for in paragraph 2(b) of this Protocol, the provisions of this Treaty shall apply only to property, including rights and interests, which fall within the scope of the activity to which the notification refers.</p>
        <p>(b) Without prejudice to other procedures for determining nationality, a person shall be deemed to be a national of a Contracting Party if he or she holds a national passport issued by the competent authorities of the Contracting Party in question.</p>
        <p>(8) Each Contracting Party shall refrain from taking measures contrary to the principles of free competition and likely to eliminate or hinder the participation of the maritime and air navigation of the other Contracting Party in the transport of goods intended for capital investment within the meaning of this Treaty. This provision shall also apply to goods acquired in the territory of a Contracting Party or of a Third State with funds from an enterprise in which capital is invested within the meaning of this Treaty.</p>
