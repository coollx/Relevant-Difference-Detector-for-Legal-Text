      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Treatment of investments">
        <p>(1)  Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investments and returns of investors of the other Contracting Party treatment which is fair and equitable and no less favourable than that which it accords to investments and returns of its own investors or to investments and returns of investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to investors.</p>
        <p>(2)  Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investors of the other Contracting Party as regards management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments, treatment which is fair and equitable and no less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to investors.</p>
        <p>(3)  The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to the investors of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege which may be extended by the former Contracting Party by virtue of:</p>

        <p>(a)  requisitioning of their property by its forces or authorities; or</p>
        <p>(b)  destruction of their property by its forces or authorities which was not caused in combat action or was not required by the necessity of the situation,</p>
        <p>Shall be accorded prompt restitution and, where applicable, prompt, adequate and effective compensation.

The expropriation shall be carried out on a non-discriminatory basis in accordance with legal procedures.</p>
        <p>(2)  Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the expropriated investments immediately before expropriation was taken or before impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, shall include interest at the applicable commercial rate from the date of expropriation until the date of payment and shall be made without undue delay, be effectively realizable and be freely transferable. In both expropriation and compensation, treatment no less favourable than that which the Contracting Party accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State shall be accorded.</p>
        <p>(3)  Investors of one Contracting Party affected by expropriation shall have a right to prompt review by a judicial or other competent independent authority of the other Contracting Party, of their case and of the valuation of their investments in accordance with the principles set out in this Article.</p>
        <p>(4)  Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is incorporated or constituted under its laws and regulations, and in which investors of the other Contracting Party participate or own shares or debentures, the provision of this Article shall be applied.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Transfers">
        <p>(1)  Each Contracting Party shall guarantee to investors of the other Contracting Party the free transfer of their investments and returns. Such transfers shall include, in particular, though not exclusively:</p>

        <p>(e)  additional funds necessary for the maintenance or development of the existing investments;</p>
        <p>(f)  amounts spent for the management of the investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party or a third State; and</p>
        <p>(g)  compensation pursuant to Articles 4 and 5.</p>
        <p>(2)  All transfers under this Agreement shall be made in a freely convertible currency, without undue restriction and delay, at the market exchange rate which is effective for the current transactions or determined in accordance with the official rate of exchange in force on the date of transfers in the territory of the other Contracting Party in which the investment is made, whichever is more favourable to investors.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If a Contracting Party or its designated agency makes a payment to its own investors under an indemnity given in respect of investments, the latter Contracting Party shall recognize:</p>
        <p>(a)  the assignment, whether under the law or pursuant to a legal transaction in that State, of any rights or claims from investors to the former Contracting Party or its designated agency; and</p>
        <p>(b)  that the former Contracting Party or its designated agency is entitled by virtue of subrogation to exercise the rights of and enforce the claims of those investors.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Settlement of investment disputes between a contracting party and an investor of the other contracting party">
        <p>(1)  Any investment dispute between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting shall as far as possible be settled by the parties to the dispute in an amicable way.</p>
        <p>(2)  The local remedies under the laws and regulations of one Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment has been made shall be available for investors of the other Contracting Party on the basis of treatment no less favourable than that accorded to investments of its own investors or investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to investors.</p>
        <p>(3)  If the dispute cannot be settled within six(6) months from the date on which the dispute has been raised by either party, it shall be submitted upon request of the investor of the Contracting Party, to the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, opened for signature in Washington on March 18th, 1965. In case of arbitration, each Contracting Party, by this Agreement irrevocably consents in advance, even in the absence of an individual arbitral agreement between the Contracting Party and the investor, to submit any such dispute to the ICSID. This consent implies the renunciation of the requirement that the internal administrative or judicial remedies should be exhausted.</p>

These two members shall then select a national of a third State, who on approval of the two Contracting Parties shall be appointed Chairman of the Tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within two (2) months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>(4)  If within the periods specified in paragraph (3) of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, a request may be made by either Contracting Party to the President of the International Court of Justice to make such appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the appointments. If the Vice-President also is a national of either Contracting Party or prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the appointments.</p>
        <p>(5)  The Arbitral Tribunal shall establish its own rules of procedure. The Arbitral Tribunal shall reach its decision by virtue of this Agreement and pursuant to the rules of international law. And the Arbitral Tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be final and binding.</p>
        <p>(6)  Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of its own arbitrator and its representation in the arbitral proceedings.

        <p>(3)  Either Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation that it may have entered into with regard to investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Application of the agreement">
