        <p>a) Any natural person who is a national of a Contracting Party, in accordance with its laws.</p>

        <p>(5) The provisions of paragraph (2) of this Article shall not be construed so as to extend to the investors of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from the bilateral agreements providing for concessional financing concluded by the Republic of Argentina with Italy on 10 December 1987 and with Spain on 3 June 1988.</p>
      </div>

      <div type="article" num="8" title="Consultations">
        <p>Either Contracting Party may propose to the other Contracting Party to consult on any matter affecting the interpretation or application of the present Agreement.

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Settlement of disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>(1) Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement should, if possible, be settled through the diplomatic channel.</p>
        <p>(2) If a dispute between the Contracting Parties cannot thus be settled within six months from the beginning of the negotiations, it shall upon the request of either Contracting Party be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>(3) Such arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way. Within two months of the receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the Tribunal.

The Chairman shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>(4) If within the periods specified in paragraph (3) of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments.

The tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Settlement of disputes between an investor and the host contracting party">

        <p>- the competent tribunal of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made;</p>
        <p>- international arbitration according to the provisions of paragraph (3).</p>
        <p>Where an investor has submitted a dispute to the aforementioned competent tribunal of the Contracting Party where the investment has been made or to international arbitration, this choice shall be final.</p>
        <p>(3) In case of international arbitration, the dispute shall be submitted, at the investor's choice, either to:</p>

        <p>(5) The arbitral decisions shall be final and binding for the parties in the dispute. Each Contracting Party shall execute them in accordance with its laws.</p>
