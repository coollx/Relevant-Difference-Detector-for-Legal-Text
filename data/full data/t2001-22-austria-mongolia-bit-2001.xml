        <p>(a) Any natural person who is a citizen of one of the Contracting Parties and makes an investment in the other Contracting Party's territory;</p>
        <p>(b) Any juridical person or partnership, constituted in accordance with the legislation of one of the Contracting Parties, having its seat in the territory of this Contracting Party and making an investment in the other Contracting Party's territory;</p>
        <p>(c) Any juridical person or partnership, constituted in accordance with the legislation of a Contracting Party or of a third Party in which the investor referred to in a) or b) exercises a dominant influence;</p>
        <p>(3) The term "returns" means the amounts yielded by an investment and, in particular though not exclusively, profits, interests, capital gains, dividends, royalties, licence and other fees.</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion and protection of investments">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote, as far as possible, investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, admit such investments in accordance with its legislation and in any case accord such investments fair and equitable treatment.</p>
        <p>(2) Investments admitted according to Article 2 paragraph (1) and their returns shall enjoy the full protection of the present Agreement. The same applies without prejudice to the regulations of paragraph (1) also for their returns in case of reinvestment of such returns. The legal extension, alteration or transformation of an investment is considered to be a new investment.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Treatment of investments">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall accord to investors of the other Contracting Party and their investments treatment no less favourable than that accorded to its own investors and their investments or to investors of any third State and their investments.</p>
        <p>(2) The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not be construed as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to the investors of the other Contracting Party and their investments the present or future benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from</p>
        <p>(a) Any customs union, common market, free trade area or membership in an economic community,</p>

        <p>(1) Investments of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be expropriated in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose by due process of law and against compensation.</p>
        <p>(2) Such compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market-value of the investment as determined in accordance with recognized principles of valuation taking into account such as inter alia the capital invested, replacement value, appreciation, current returns, goodwill and other relevant factors, immediately prior to or at the time when the decision for expropriation was announced or became publicly known, whichever is the earlier. In the event that the payment of compensation is delayed, such compensation shall be paid in an amount which would put the investor in a position not less favourable than the position in which he would have been had the compensation been paid immediately on the date of expropriation. To achieve this goal the compensation shall include interest at the prevailing commercial rate, however, in no event less than the current LIBOR-rate or equivalent from the date of expropriation until the date of payment. The amount of compensation finally determined shall be promptly paid to the investor in freely convertible currencies and allowed to be freely transferred without delay.</p>
        <p>(3) Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is considered as a company of this Contracting Party pursuant to paragraph (2) of Article 1 of the present Agreement and in which an investor of the other Contracting Party owns shares, it shall apply the provisions of paragraph (1) so as to ensure due compensation to this investor.</p>
        <p>(4) The investor shall be entitled to have the legality of the expropriation reviewed by the competent authorities of the Contracting Party having induced the expropriation.</p>
        <p>(5) The investor shall be entitled to have the amount and the provisions for the payment of the compensation reviewed either by the competent authorities of the Contracting Party having induced the expropriation or by an international arbitral tribunal according to Article 8 of the present Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Transfers">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall guarantee without undue delay to investors of the other Contracting Party free transfer in freely convertible currency of payments in connection with an investment, in particular but not exclusively, of</p>

        <p>(b) Amounts assigned to cover expenses relating to the management of the investment;</p>
        <p>(c) The returns;</p>
        <p>(d) The repayment of loans;</p>
        <p>(e) The proceeds from total or partial liquidation or sale of the investment;</p>
        <p>(f) A compensation according to Article 4 paragraph (1) of the present Agreement;</p>
        <p>(2) The payments referred to in this Article shall be effected at the exchange rates prevailing on the day of the transfer of payments in the territory of the Contracting Party from which the transfer is made.</p>

The latter Contracting Party shall also recognize the subrogation of the former Contracting Party to any such rights or claims which that Contracting Party shall be entitled to assert to the same extent as its predecessor in title. As regards the transfer of payments to the Contracting Party concerned by virtue of such assignment, Article 4 and Article 5 of the present Agreement shall apply mutatis mutandis.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Other obligations">

        <p>(2) Each Contracting Party shall observe any contractual obligation it may have entered into towards an investor of the other Contracting Party with regard to investments approved by it in its territory.</p>
