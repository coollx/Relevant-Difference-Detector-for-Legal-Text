          <p>2. The restrictions referred to in paragraph 1 shall:</p>
          <p>(a) Be consistent with the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund;</p>

        </div>
        <div type="article" num="10" title="Health, Safety and Environmental Measures">
          <p>The Parties reccognise that it is inappropriate to encourage investment by relaxing domestic health, safety or environmental measures.

          <p>(c) In deciding an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall assume to be true the disputing investor's factual allegations in support of any claim in the notice of arbitration (or any amendment thereof) and, in disputes brought under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the statement of claim referred to in the relevant article of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The tribunal may also consider any relevant facts not in dispute.</p>
          <p>(d) The respondent Party does not waive any objection as to competence or any argument on the merits merely because the respondent Party did or did not raise an objection under this paragraph or made use of the expedited procedure set out in paragraph 3.</p>
          <p>3. In the event that the respondent Party so requests within 45 days after the tribunal is constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis all objection under paragraph 2 and any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal's competence. The tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits and issue a decision or award on the objection(s), stating the grounds therefor, no later than 150 days after the date of the request. However, if a disputing party requests a hearing, the tribunal may take an additional 30 days to issue the decision or award. Regardless of whether a hearing is requested, a tribunal may, on a showing of extraordinary cause, delay issuing its decision or award by an additional brief period, which may not exceed 30 days.</p>
          <p>4. When deciding the respondent Party's objection under paragraph 2 or 3, the tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney's fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection. In determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claim of the disputing investor or the respondent Party's objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment.</p>

          <p>2. Neither Party shall give diplomatic protection, or bring an intemational claim, in respect of a dispute which one of its investors and the other Party shall have consented to submit or have submitted to arbitration under this Section, unless such other Party has failed to abide by and comply with the award rendered in such dispute. Diplomatic protection, for the purposes of this paragraph, shall not include informal diplomatic exchanges for the sole purpose of facilitating a settlement of the dispute.</p>

          <p>(b) Restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide that the respondent Party may pay monetary damages and any applicable interest in lieu of restitution.</p>

          <p>2. Any arbitral award shall be final and binding upon the disputing parties. Each Party shall ensure the recognition and enforcement of the award in accordance with its relevant laws and regulations.</p>
          <p>3. Where a claim is submitted on behalf an enterprise of the respondent Party, the arbitral award shall be made to the enterprise.</p>
          <p>4. In any arbitration conducted under this Section, at the request of a disputing party, a tribunal shall, before issuing a decision or award on liability, transmit its proposed decision or award to the disputing parties.

          <p>2. A disputing party that seeks a consolidation order under this Article shall deliver, in writing, a request to the Secretary-General of ICSID and to all the disputing parties sought to be covered by the order, specifying the name and address of all the disputing parties sought to be covered by the order; the nature of the order sought; and the grounds on which the order is sought.</p>

          <p>6. Where a tribunal established under this Article is satisfied that two or more claims that have been submitted to arbitration in accordance with Article 13 (Institution of Arbitral Proceedings), have a question of law or fact in common, and arise out of the same events or circumstances, the tribunal may, in the interest of fair and efficient resolution of the claims, and after hearing the disputing parties, by order:</p>
          <p>(a) Assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine together, all or part of the claims;</p>
          <p>(b) Assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine one or more claims, whose determination it considers would assist in the resolution of the other claims; or</p>
          <p>(c) Instruct a tribunal previously established under Article 14 (Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal) to assume jurisdiction over and to hear and determine together, all or part of the claims, provided that:</p>
          <p>(i) That tribunal, at the request of any disputing investor, not previously a disputing party before that tribunal, shall be reconstituted with its original members, except that the arbitrator for the disputing investors shall be appointed pursuant to paragraphs 4(a) and 5; and</p>
          <p>(ii) That tribunal shall decide whether any previous hearing must be repeated,</p>
          <p>7.

    </conclusion>
    <attachments>
      <p>The Partes confirm their shared understanding that:</p>
      <p>1. An action or a series of actions by a Party cannot constitute an expropriation unless it interferes with a tangible or intangible property right or property interest in an investment.</p>
      <p>2. Article 5.1 (Expropiation) addresses two situations. The first is direct expropriation, where an investment is nationalised or otherwise directly expropriated through formal transfer of title or outright seizure.</p>
      <p>3. The second situation addressed by Article 5.1 (Expropliation) is indirect expropriation, where an action or series of actions by a Party has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure. (a) The determination of whether an action or series of actions by a Party, in a specific fact situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation, requires a case-by- case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors: (i) The economic impact of the government action, although the fact that an action or series of actions by a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that an indirect expropriation has ocurred;</p>
      <p>(ii) The extent to which the government action interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; and</p>
      <p>(iii) The character of the government action.</p>
      <p>(b) Except in rare circumstance where the impact of an action or series of actions is so severe in light of its purpose that it appears manifestly excessive non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as but not limited to public health, safety and the environment, do not constitute an indirect expropriation.</p>
