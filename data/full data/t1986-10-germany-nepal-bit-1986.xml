      <p>Investments made, in accordance with the laws and regulations of either Contracting Party, within the area of application of the law of that Party by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party concerned shall be deemed to be a national of that Party shall enjoy the full protection of this Treaty</p>
      <p>(3) Ad Article 3</p>
      <p>(a) The following shall more particularly, though not exclusively be deemed "activity" within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 3: the management, maintenance, use, and enjoyment of an investment. The following shall, in particular, be deemed "treatment less favourable" within the meaning of Aticle 3: restricting the purchases of raw or auxiliary materials, of energy or fuel or of means of production or operation of any kind, impeding the marketing of products inside or outside the country, as well as any other measures having similar effects. Measures that have to be taken for reasons of public security and order, public health or morality shall not be deemed "treatment less favourable" within the meaning of Article 3.</p>
      <p>(b) The provisions of Article 3 do not oblige a Contracting Party to extend to natural persons or companies resident in the territory of the other Contracting Party tax privileges, tax exemptions and tax reductions which according to its tax laws are granted only to natural persons and companies resident in its territory.</p>
      <p>(c) The Contracting Parties shall within the framework of their national legislation give sympathetic consideration to applications for the entry and sojourn of persons of either Contracting Party who wish to enter the territory of the other Contracting Party in connexion with the making and carrying through of an investment: the same apply to nationals of either Contracting Party who in connexion with an investment wish to enter the territory of the other Contracting Party and work there temporarily. Applications for work permits shall also be given sympathetic consideration.</p>
      <p>(4) Ad Article 4</p>
      <p>(a) "Expropriation" shall mean any taking away or restricting tantamount to the taking away of any property right when in itself or in conjunction with other rights constitutes an investment.</p>
      <p>(b) A claim to compensation shall also exist if, as a result of State intervention in the company in which the investment is made, its economic substance is severely impaired.</p>
      <p>(5) Ad Article 5</p>
      <p>In the event of exceptional balance of payments difficulties the transfer of the proceeds from the liquidation or from the sale of the investment may be restricted to annual instalments of at least 20 per cent so that the transfer will be completed within a maximum period of five years.</p>
      <p>(6) Ad Article 7</p>
      <p>A transfer shall be deemed to have been made "without delay" within the meaning of paragraph 1 of Article 7 if effected within such period as is normally required for the completion of transfer formalities. The said period shall commence on the day on which the relevant request has been submitted and may on no account exceed two months.</p>
      <p>(7) Whenever goods or persons connected with the making of investments are to be transported, each Contracting Party shall neither exclude nor hinder transport enterprises of the other Contracting Party and shall issue permits as required to carry out such transport. This shall include the transport by land, air and sea of:</p>
      <p>(a) Goods directly intended for an investment within the meaning of the present Treaty or acquired in the territory of either Contracting Party or of any third State by or on behalf of an enterprise in which assets within the meaning of the present Treaty are invested;</p>
      <p>(b) Persons travelling in connexion with the making and carrying through of investments.</p>
      <p>Done at Bonn on October 20th, 1985 in duplicate in German, Nepali and English languages, all texts being authentic. In case of a divergent interpretation of the German and Nepali texts the English text shall prevail.</p>
