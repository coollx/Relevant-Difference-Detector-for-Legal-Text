      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Subrogation">
        <p>1. If one Contracting Party or a public agency of that Party pays compensation to its own investors under an investment guarantee against non-commercial risks, the other Contracting Party shall recognize that the investors' rights and shares have been transferred to the Contracting Party or public agency concerned, without prejudice to the right of subrogation recognized by commercial legislation in the case of insurance against commercial risks. </p>
        <p>2. As far as the transferred rights are concerned, the other Contracting Party may invoke against the insurer who is subrogated into the rights of the compensated investors the obligations legally or contractually incumbent on the latter, </p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Applicable rules">

      <div type="article" num="9" title="Settlement of investment disputes">
        <p>1. Any dispute between an investor of one of the Contracting Parties and the other Contracting Party which affects the application of this Agreement shall be the subject of a written notification, accompanied by a sufficiently detailed memorandum, from the investor. </p>
        <p>As far as possible, the parties shall endeavour to settle the dispute amicably by negotiation, where necessary seeking expert advice from a third party, or by conciliation. </p>
        <p>2. In the absence of an amicable settlement within six months from the date of notification of the dispute, the dispute shall be submitted, at the investor's option, either to the competent jurisdiction of the State in which the investment was made or to international arbitration. Once made, this choice shall be final. </p>
        <p>To this end, each Contracting Party shall agree in advance and irrevocably to the sub- mission of any dispute to such arbitration. </p>
        <p>3. In the event of recourse to international arbitration, the dispute shall be submitted to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965. </p>

        <p>6. The arbitral award shall determine only whether the Contracting Party in question has failed to fulfil an obligation under this Agreement, and whether the investor has suffered losses as a result, and shall set the amount of compensation which Contracting Partly must pay to the investor. </p>
        <p>7. Arbitral awards shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute. Each Contracting Party shall undertake to execute such awards in accordance with its national legislation. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Disputes between the contracting parties relating to interpretation or application">
        <p>1, Any dispute relating to the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be settled, if possible, through the diplomatic channel. </p>
        <p>2. Failing settlement through the diplomatic channel, the dispute shall be submitted to a joint commission consisting of representatives of the two Parties; this commission shall meet without undue delay at the request of the initiating Party. </p>
        <p>3. If the dispute cannot be settled by the joint commission within six months, it shall be submitted, at the request of either Contracting Party, to an arbitration procedure conducted, in each individual case, in the following manner: </p>
        <p>Each Contracting Party shall appoint an arbitrator within two months from the date on which one Contracting Party notifies the other of its intention to submit the dispute to arbitration. Within two months from their appointment, the two arbitrators shall appoint by mutual agreement a national of a third State to serve as chairman of the board of arbitrators. </p>
        <p>If these time limits are not met, either Contracting Party shall invite the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed. </p>
        <p>If the President of the International Court of Justice is a national of either Contracting Party or of a State with which one of the Contracting Parties has no diplomatic relations, or if for any other reason he or she is prevented from performing this function, the Vice-President of the International Court of Justice shall be invited to make the appointment or appointments. If the Vice-President of the Court is a national of either Contracting Party, or if for any other reason he or she is prevented from performing this function, the most senior member of the Court who is not a national of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the appointment or appointments. </p>
        <p>4. The board thus constituted shall establish its own rules of procedure. Its decisions shall be taken by majority vote; they shall be final and binding on the Contracting Parties. </p>
        <p>5. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of appointing its arbitrator. The cost of appointing the third arbitrator and the operating costs of the board shall be borne equally by the Contracting Parties. </p>
