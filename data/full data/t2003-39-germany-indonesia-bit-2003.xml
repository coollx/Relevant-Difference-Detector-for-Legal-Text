      <p>PROTOCOL</p>
      <p>On signing the Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Indonesia concerning the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, it was agreed, in addition, that the following provisions shall be regarded as an integral part of the said Agreement:</p>
      <p>(1)</p>
      <p>(a) Returns from the investment and, in the event of their re- investment, the returns therefrom shall enjoy the same pro- tection as the investment.</p>
      <p>(b) Without prejudice to any other method of determining nationality, in particular any person in possession of a national passport issued by the competent authorities of the Contracting Party concerned shall be deemed to be a national of that Contracting Party.</p>
      <p>(2) Whenever goods or persons connected with an investment are to be transported, each Contracting Party shall neither exclude nor hinder transport enterprises of the other Contracting Party and shall issue permits as required to carry out such transport in accordance with its laws and regulations.</p>
      <p>(3)</p>
      <p>(a) The following shall more particularly, though not exclusively, be deemed "activity" within the meaning of Article 3 (2): the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment and disposal of an investment. The following shall, in particular, be deemed "treatment less favourable" within the meaning of Article 3: unequal treatment in the case of restrictions on the pur- chase of raw or auxiliary materials, of energy or fuel or of means of production or operation of any kind, unequal treat- ment in the case of impeding the marketing of products in- side or outside the country, as well as any other measures having similar effects. Measures that have to be taken for reasons of public security and order, public health or moral- ity shall not be deemed "treatment less favourable" within the meaning of Article 3.</p>
      <p>(b) The provisions of Article 3 do not oblige a Contracting Party to extend to investors resident in the territory of the other Contracting Party tax privileges, tax exemptions and tax reductions which according to its tax laws are granted only to investors resident in its territory.</p>
      <p>(c) The Contracting Parties shall within the framework of their national laws and regulations give prompt consideration to applications for the entry and sojourn of persons of either Contracting Party who wish to enter the territory of the other Contracting Party in connection with an investment; the same shall apply to employed persons of either Contracting Party who in connection with an investment wish to enter the territory of the other Contracting Party and sojourn there to take up employment. Applications for work permits shall also be given prompt consideration in conformity with its laws and regulations.</p>
      <p>(4) A transfer shall be deemed to have been made "without delay" within the meaning of Article 5 (2) if effected within such period as is normally required for the completion of transfer formalities. The said period shall commence on the day on which the rele- vant request has been submitted and may on no account exceed two months.</p>
      <p>(5) An investor from the Republic of Indonesia who has made an investment in the Federal Republic of Germany can appeal to an international arbitration tribunal in the same dispute after a German national court has rendered a decision in substance. An investor from the Federal Republic of Germany who has made an investment in the Republic of Indonesia can appeal to an international arbitration tribunal or to a local court. In case the dispute has been brought to an Indonesian court, the dis- pute can only be submitted for arbitration if it can be withdrawn by the investor according to Indonesian laws and regulations.</p>
      <p>(6) Consultations can include, if deemed necessary, the question of an amendment of this Agreement by mutual consent of the Contracting Parties.</p>
