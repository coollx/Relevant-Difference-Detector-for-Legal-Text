        <b>Protocol</b>
      </p>
      <p>At the time of the signing of the Agreement between the Republic of Austria and the People's Republic of China on the promotion and mutual protection of investments, the undersigned Plenipotentiaries also made the following agreements, which form an integral part of the Agreement:</p>
      <div type="article" title="To article 2">
        <p>Investments made in accordance with the law of a Contracting Party by investors in the areas in which the former Contracting Party exercises sovereign powers or sovereignty also enjoy full protection under this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" title="To article 3">
        <p>a) The "less favorable treatment" within the meaning of Article 3 (2) or as "discriminatory measures" within the meaning of Article 3 (4) are, in particular, the restriction on the purchase of raw materials and auxiliary materials, energy, production and operating materials and measures with a similar effect.</p>
        <p>b) Measures of a Contracting Party shall not be regarded as "discriminatory measures" within the meaning of Article 3 paragraph 4,</p>
        <p>- Taken for reasons of public security and public order or public health or morality,</p>
        <p>- Which are made on the basis of economic priorities, provided that they are not particularly aimed at investors from the other party or against joint ventures involving investors from the other party.</p>
        <p>c) For persons to act in connection with the making and carrying out of an investment in the territory of the other party, the other party will, within the framework of its legislation, issue visas as soon as possible and, if necessary, apply for an employment permit Check benevolently and quickly decide on them.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" title="To article 4">
        <p>a) Where an investor of a Party has an overriding interest in a legal person, entity or association, whether legal or otherwise, of a third State, Article 4 (1) shall apply to that investor of either Party even if the other Party invests in them expropriated legal entity, organization or association of the third state. However, the provisions relating to compensation shall only apply if that legal person, organization or group of the third State or the third State itself is not entitled to claim compensation or the third State waives that right.</p>
        <p>b) The international arbitration tribunal referred to in Article 4, paragraph 5, shall be formed on a case-by-case basis, with each side appointing a member and both members agreeing to chair the nationals of a third country with which both parties have diplomatic relations. Within two months after the investor has informed the other party that he intends to submit the dispute to an arbitral tribunal, the members shall be appointed within two months. Failure to comply with any other agreement may result in each side requesting the chairman of the Arbitration Tribunal of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce to make the necessary appointments. The arbitral tribunal establishes its procedural rules by applying the procedural rules of the Convention of March 18, 1965 on the settlement of investment disputes between states and nationals of other states. The court decides by majority vote; the decision is final and binding; it is enforced under domestic law. The decision must indicate the basis on which it was made; it must be justified at the request of one side or the other. Each side bears the cost of its member and its representation in the arbitration; the costs of the chairman and other costs are borne equally by both sides.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" title="To article 5">
        <p>The expression "Each Party shall guarantee the investors of the other Party the free transfer of payments in connection with an investment" in accordance with Article 5 means, with regard to the People's Republic of China:</p>
        <p>(1) Compensation payments in accordance with Article 5 lit. f will be freely transferred in convertible currency with the guarantee of the relevant Chinese government authorities.</p>
        <p>(2) a) Payments in accordance with Article 5 lit. a-e will be transferred from foreign currency account of the Joint Undertaking or from the foreign currency account of the enterprise with foreign capital only, as long as the foreign exchange regulations of the People's Republic of China do not provide for more favorable regulations.</p>
        <p>b) If such a company does not have sufficient foreign currency in its account for payments under lit. 2 (a) of this point, the GOC will provide the foreign exchange required for the transfer in the following cases:</p>
        <p>- For payments under Article 5 lit. a, lit. d and lit. e;</p>
        <p>- For payments under Article 5 lit. c, if the Bank of China has granted a guarantee;</p>
        <p>- For payments under Article 5 lit. b. if a joint venture or a company with exclusively foreign capital, with the special approval of a competent government agency, also discontinues its production against a currency that is not freely convertible.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" title="To article 7, paragraph 1">
        <p>A "transfer without undue delay" within the meaning of Article 7 (1) shall be deemed to take place within a time limit normally required to comply with the transfer options. The period begins with the submission of a corresponding application and may in the cases of Article 5 lit. a-e three months and in the cases of Article 5 lit. f do not exceed six months.</p>
