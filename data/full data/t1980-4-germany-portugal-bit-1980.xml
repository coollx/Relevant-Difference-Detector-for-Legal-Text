        <p>At the time of signing the Treaty on the Claims and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Portuguese Republic, the undersigned Plenipotentiaries also made the following agreements, which shall be deemed to be integral parts of the Treaty:</p>
        <p>1. Ad Article 1</p>
        <p>(a) The income from the investment and, in the event of its reinvestment, the income therefrom, shall enjoy the same protection as the investment.</p>
        <p>(b) In particular, without prejudice to other procedures for determining nationality, any person holding a national passport issued by the competent authorities of the Contracting Party concerned shall be deemed to be a national of that Party.</p>
        <p>2. Ad Article 2</p>
        <p>Investments made in accordance with the laws of one Contracting Party in its territory by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party shall enjoy the full protection of this Treaty.</p>
        <p>3. Ad Article 3</p>
        <p>(a) For the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 3, "activity" shall mean in particular, but not exclusively, the management, use, enjoyment and enjoyment of an investment. "Less favorable" treatment within the meaning of Article 3, paragraph 2, shall be deemed to include, in particular, restrictions on the use of raw materials and supplies, energy and fuels, and means of production and inputs of all kinds, obstruction of the sale of products at home and abroad, and other measures having a similar effect. Measures to be taken for reasons of public safety and order, public health or morality shall not be considered as "less favorable" treatment within the meaning of Article 3.</p>
        <p>(b) The Contracting Parties shall, within the framework of their internal legislation, give favourable consideration to applications for the entry and residence of persons of one Party who wish to enter the territory of the other Party in connection with the making and carrying out of a capital investment; the same shall apply to workers of one Party who wish to enter and reside in the territory of the other Party in connection with a capital investment in order to carry on an activity as a worker.  Applications for work permits will also be favorably considered.</p>
        <p>(c) The Parties consider that restrictions on access to medium and long-term credit are not incompatible with the provisions of Article 3.</p>
        <p>4. Ad Article 4</p>
        <p>(a) Expropriation shall be understood to mean any form of deprivation or restriction of property or rights constituting a capital asset or a part thereof, as well as any other act of public authority having the effect of a permanent expropriation.</p>
        <p>(b) A claim for compensation shall also exist if the enterprise which is the subject of the capital investment is interfered with by State measures and its economic substance is thereby substantially impaired and this is ultimately attributable to such intervention.</p>
        <p>(c) The provisions of Article 4, paragraph 2, concerning transfer shall apply only if the expropriated or nationalized capital investment has been made on the basis of imported assets, including reinvestment and added value.</p>
        <p>(d) If the damage caused by any of the events referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 4 has resulted in a total loss of the investment, any payment made by way of damages, compensation or other consideration shall be treated in the same way as compensation payments under paragraph 2 of this Article.</p>
        <p>5. Ad Article 5</p>
        <p>When, in the event of extreme balance of payments difficulties, the Portuguese Government is unable to transfer income and proceeds of liquidation within six months of the due date, it may, by decision of the Council of Ministers, suspend such transfers for a limited period of time and only to the extent required by the difficulties referred to above. However, it undertakes that the amount to be transferred shall in no case be less than 20% per annum of the total amount to be transferred.</p>
        <p>In such a case, and if the investor so wishes, the amounts not transferred will be credited to a special account in a currency of the investor's choice. The interest to be paid shall be determined on the basis of the interest rates applied for corresponding borrowing on the financial market of the country whose preservation has been chosen.</p>
        <p>6. Ad Article 6</p>
        <p>It is understood that the investment guarantee referred to in Article 6 covers only political risks, including transfer risk.</p>
        <p>7. Ad Article 7</p>
        <p>For the purposes of Article 7, paragraph 1, a transfer shall be deemed to have been effected "without delay" if it is effected within a period of time normally required for the observance of the transfer formalities. This period shall commence on the date on which a complete application, accompanied by the required documents, has been submitted and shall under no circumstances exceed three months.</p>
        <p>The application shall be considered complete even if missing documents could not be provided due to the exclusive responsibility of the competent authorities of the respective Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>The deduction of taxes from amounts to be transferred [Article 5, letters b) and d)] shall not result in a delay of the transfer.</p>
        <p>8. In the case of transportation of goods and persons in connection with the making of capital investments, the Contracting Parties shall neither eliminate nor hinder the transportation companies of the other Contracting Party and shall, if necessary, grant permission for the transportation to be carried out.</p>
        <p>This shall include transports of</p>
        <p>a) goods directly intended for investment within the meaning of this Treaty or acquired in the territory of a Contracting Party or of a third State by or on behalf of an enterprise in which assets within the meaning of this Treaty are invested;</p>
        <p>b) persons traveling in connection with the making of investments.</p>
