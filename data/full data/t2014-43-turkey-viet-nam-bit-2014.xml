        <p>5. Unless otherwise agreed, the tribunal shall have three (3) months from the date of the&nbsp;selection of the Chairman to agree upon rules of procedure consistent with the other&nbsp;provisions of this Agreement.

Unless otherwise agreed, all submissions shall be made and all hearings shall be&nbsp;completed within eight (8) months of the date of selection of the Chairman, and the&nbsp;tribunal shall render its decision within two (2) months after the date of the final&nbsp;submissions or the date of the closing of the hearings, whichever is later.

        <p>7. Expenses incurred by the Chairman, the other arbitrators, and other costs of the&nbsp;proceedings shall be paid for equally by the Contracting Parties. The tribunal may,&nbsp;however, at its discretion, decide that a higher proportion of the costs be paid by one of the&nbsp;Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>8. A dispute shall not be submitted to an international arbitration court under the provisions&nbsp;of this Article, if the same dispute has been brought before another international arbitration&nbsp;court under the provisions of Article 9 and is still before the court. This will not impair the&nbsp;engagement in direct and meaningful negotiations between both Contracting Parties.</p>
