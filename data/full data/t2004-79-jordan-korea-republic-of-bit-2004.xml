        <p>2. Investments made by investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment in accordance with international law and shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the operation, development, expansion, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Treatment of investments">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investments and returns of investors of the other Contracting Party treatment which is fair and equitable and no less favorable than that which it accords to investments and returns of its own investors or to investments and returns of investors of any third State, whichever is more favorable to the investor concerned.</p>
        <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investors of the other Contracting Party as regards the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments, treatment which is fair and equitable and no less favorable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is more favorable to the investor concerned.</p>
        <p>3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to the investors of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from any international agreement or arrangement relating wholly or mainly to taxation or any existing or future customs union or economic union, free trade area or similar international agreement to which either Contracting Party is or may become a party in the future.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="Compensation for losses">
        <p>1. Investors of one Contracting Party whose investments suffer losses owing to war or other armed conflict, a state of national emergency, revolt, insurrection, riot or other similar situations in the territory of the other Contracting Party, shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party, treatment, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other forms of settlement, no less favorable than that which the latter Contracting Party accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State. Resulting payments shall be freely transferable without undue delay.</p>
        <p>2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1 of this Article, investors of one Contracting Party who, in any of the situations referred to in that paragraph, suffer losses in the territory of the other Contracting Party resulting from:</p>

        <p>(b) Destruction of their property by its forces or authorities which was not caused in combat action or was not required by the necessity of the situation,</p>
        <p>shall be accorded restitution or adequate compensation, which shall not be less favorable than that which would be accorded under the same circumstances to an investor of the latter Contracting Party or to an investor of any other State. Resulting payments shall be freely transferable without undue delay.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Expropriation">

The expropriation shall be carried out on a non-discriminatory basis in accordance with due process of law.</p>
        <p>2. Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the expropriated investments immediately before expropriation was taken or before impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, shall include interest at the applicable commercial rate from the date of expropriation until the date of payment and shall be made without undue delay, be effectively realizable and be freely convertible and transferable. In both expropriation and compensation, treatment no less favorable than that which the Contracting Party accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State shall be accorded.</p>
        <p>3. Investors of one Contracting Party affected by expropriation shall have a right to prompt review by a judicial or other competent and independent authority of the other Contracting Party, of their case and of the valuation of their investments in accordance with the principles set out in this Article.</p>
        <p>4. Where a Contracting Party expropriates the asset of a company which is incorporated or constituted under its legislation, and in which investors of the other Contracting Party own shares, debentures or other forms of participation, the provisions of this Article shall be applied.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Transfers">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall guarantee to investors of the other Contracting Party the free transfer of all payments, into and out of its territory, relating to their investments and returns. Such transfers shall include, in particular, though not exclusively:</p>
        <p>(a) The initial capital and additional amounts to maintain or increase an investment;</p>
        <p>(b) Returns;</p>
        <p>(c) Proceeds accruing from the sale or the total or partial liquidation of investments;</p>
        <p>(d) Funds in repayment of loans related to investments;</p>

        <p>(f) Compensation pursuant to Articles 4, 5; and</p>
        <p>(g) Payments arising out of the settlement of an investment dispute.</p>

      <div type="article" num="7" title="Subrogation">
        <p>1. If one Contracting Party or its designated agency (for the purpose of this Article; the "First Contracting Party") makes a payment under an indemnity given in respect of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party (for the purpose of this Article; the "Second Contracting Party"), the Second Contracting Party shall recognize:</p>
        <p>(a) The assignment to the First Contracting Party by law or by legal transaction of all the rights and claims of the party indemnified; and</p>
        <p>(b) That the First Contracting Party is entitled to exercise such rights and enforce such claims by virtue of subrogation, to the same extent as the party indemnified, and shall assume the obligations related to the investment.</p>
        <p>2. The First Contracting Party shall be entitled in all circumstances to:</p>
        <p>(a) The same treatment in respect of the rights, claims and obligations acquired by it, by virtue of the assignment; and</p>
        <p>(b) Any payments received in pursuance of those rights and claims.</p>
        <p>As the party indemnified was entitled to receive by virtue of this Agreement, in respect of the investment concerned and its related returns.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Settlement of investment disputes between a contracting party and an investor of the other contracting party">
        <p>1. Any dispute between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party including expropriation or nationalization of investments shall, as far as possible, be settled by the parties to the dispute in an amicable way.</p>
        <p>2. The local remedies under the legislation of one Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment has been made shall be available for investors of the other Contracting Party on the basis of treatment no less favorable than that accorded to investments of its own investors or investors of any third State, whichever is more favorable to investors.</p>
        <p>3. If the dispute cannot be settled within six (6) months from the date on which the dispute has been raised by either party, it shall be submitted upon request of the investor, to the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) established by the Washington Convention of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States.</p>

        <p>1. Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall, if possible, be settled by consultation through diplomatic channels.</p>
        <p>2. If any dispute cannot be settled within six (6) months, it shall, at the request of either Contracting Party, be submitted to an ad hoc Arbitral Tribunal in accordance with the provisions of this Article.</p>
        <p>3. Such an Arbitral Tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way: Within two (2) months from the date of receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the Tribunal. These two members shall then select a national of a third State, who on approval of the two Contracting Parties shall be appointed Chairperson of the Tribunal. The Chairperson shall be appointed within two (2) months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>4. If within the periods specified in paragraph 3 of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, a request may be made by either Contracting Party to the President of the International Court of Justice to make such appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the appointments. If the Vice-President also is a national of either Contracting Party or prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the appointments.</p>
        <p>5. The Arbitral Tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be binding on both Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>6. Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of its own arbitrator and its representation in the arbitral proceedings. The costs of the Chairperson and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by both Contracting Parties. The Tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the two Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>7. The Arbitral Tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Application of other rules">
        <p>1.

        <p>2. If the treatment to be accorded by one Contracting Party to investors of the other Contracting Party in accordance with its legislation is more favorable than that accorded by this Agreement, the more favorable treatment shall be accorded.</p>
        <p>3. Either Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments made in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Application of the agreement">

      <div type="article" num="12" title="Entry into force, duration and termination">
        <p>1.
