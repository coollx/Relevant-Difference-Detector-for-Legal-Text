    </title>
    <preamble>
      <p>St. Lucia and the Federal Republic of Germany,</p>
      <p>Desiring to intensify economic co-operation between both States,</p>
      <p>Intending to create favourable conditions for investments by nationals and companies of either State in the territory of the other State, and</p>
      <p>Recognizing that encouragement and contractual protection of such investments are apt to stimulate private business initiative and to increase the prosperity of both nations,</p>
      <p>Have agreed as follows:</p>
    </preamble>
    <body>
      <div type="article" num="1">
        <p>For the purpose of the present Treaty</p>
        <p>1. The term "investments" shall comprise every kind of asset, in particular:</p>
        <p>(a) Movable and immovable property as well as any other property rights such as mortgages, liens and pledges;</p>
        <p>(b) Shares of companies and other kinds of interest;</p>
        <p>(c) Claims to money which has been used to create an economic value or claims to any performance under contract having an economic value;</p>
        <p>(d) Copyrights, industrial property rights, technical processes, trade-marks, trade-names, know-how, and good will;</p>
        <p>(e) Business concessions under public law, including concessions to search for, extract and exploit natural resources;</p>
        <p>Any alteration of the form in which assets are invested shall not affect their classification as investment;</p>
        <p>2. The term "returns" shall mean the amounts yielded by an investment for a definite period as profit, dividends, interest, licence or other fees;</p>
        <p>3. The term "nationals" shall mean</p>
        <p>(a) In respect of the Federal Republic of Germany: Germans within the meaning of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany;</p>
        <p>(b) In respect of St. Lucia: citizens of St. Lucia under the Citizenship of St. Lucia Act 1979 (No.7 of 1979).</p>
        <p>(4) The term "companies" shall mean</p>
        <p>(a) In respect of the Federal Republic of Germany: any juridical person as well as any commercial or other company or association with or without legal personality having its seat in the German area of application of the present Treaty and lawfully existing consistent with legal provisions, irrespective of whether the liability of its partners, associates or members is limited or unlimited and whether or not its activities are directed at profit;</p>
        <p>(b) In respect of St. Lucia: corporations, firms or associations incorporated or constituted under the commercial code of St. Lucia or other companies as may be agreed by exchange of letters between the Contracting Parties.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2">
        <p>Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote as far as possible the investment of capital by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party and admit such investments in accordance with its legislation. It shall in any case accord such investments fair and equitable treatment.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3">
        <p>(1) Neither Contracting Party shall subject investments in its territory owned or controlled by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to treatment less favourable than it accords to investments of its own nationals or companies or to investments of nationals or companies of any third State.</p>
        <p>(2) Neither Contracting Party shall subject nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, as regards their activity in connexion with investments in its territory, to treatment less favourable than it accords to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third State.</p>
        <p>(3) The treatment so granted shall not apply to privileges which either Contracting Party accords to nationals or companies of a third country because of its membership in, or association with, a customs union, an economic union, a common market or a free trade area.</p>
        <p>(4) The treatment granted under this Article shall not refer to privileges granted by either Contracting Party to nationals or companies of third States by virtue of a double taxation convention or other agreements regarding matters of taxation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4">
        <p>(1) Investments by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall enjoy full protection as well as security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>(2) Investments by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be expropriated, nationalized or subjected to any other measure the effects of which would be tantamount to expropriation or nationalization in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for the public benefit and against compensation. Such compensation shall be equivalent to the value of the investment expropriated immediately before the date the expropriation or nationalization has become public knowledge. The compensation shall be paid without delay and shall carry the usual bank interest until the time of payment; it shall be effectively realizable and freely transferable. Provision shall have been made in an appropriate manner at or prior to the time of expropriation, nationalization, or comparable measure for the determination and payment of such compensation. The legality of any such expropriation, nationalization, or comparable measure and the amount of compensation shall be subject to review by due process of law.</p>
        <p>(3) Nationals or companies of either Contracting Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Contracting Party owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency, or revolt, shall be accorded treatment no less favourable by such other Contracting Party than that Party accords to its own nationals or companies, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other valuable consideration. Such payments shall be freely transferable.</p>
        <p>(4) Nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall enjoy most-favoured-nation treatment in the territory of the other Contracting Party in respect of the matters provided for in the present Article.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall guarantee to nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party the free transfer of payments in connexion with an investment, in particular</p>
        <p>(a) Of the capital and additional amounts to maintain or increase the investment;</p>
        <p>(b) Of the returns;</p>
        <p>(c) In repayment of loans;</p>
        <p>(d) Of licence and other fees for the rights defined in sub-paragraph (d) of paragraph 1 of Article 1;</p>
        <p>(e) Of the proceeds from the sale of the whole or any part of the investment.</p>
        <p>(2) In the event of exceptional balance of payments difficulties the transfer of the proceeds from liquidation may be restricted to annual instalments of at least 20 per cent so that transfer will be completed within a maximum period of five years from the date of liquidation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6">
        <p>If either Contracting Party makes payment to any of its nationals or companies under a guarantee it has assumed in respect of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall, without prejudice to the rights of the former Contracting Party under Article 11, recognize the assignment, whether under a law or pursuant to a legal transaction, of any right or claim from such national or company to the former Contracting Party. The latter Contracting Party shall also recognize the subrogation of the former Contracting Party to any such right or claim (assigned claims) which that Contracting Party shall be entitled to assert to the same extent as its predecessor in title. As regards the transfer of payments to be made to the Contracting Party concerned by virtue of such assignment, paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 4 as well as Article 5 shall apply mutatis mutandis.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7">
        <p>(1) To the extent that those concerned have not made another arrangement admitted by the appropriate agencies of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is situated, transfers under paragraph 2 or 3 of Article 4, under Article 5 or Article 6 shall be made without delay at the rate of exchange effective for the agreed currency.</p>
        <p>(2) This rate of exchange shall correspond to the cross rate obtained from those rates which would be applied by the International Monetary Fund on the date of payment for conversions of the currencies concerned into Special Drawing Rights.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8">
        <p>(1) If the legislation of either Contracting Party or international obligations existing at present or established thereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Treaty Contain a regulation, whether general or specific, entitling investments by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by the present Treaty, such regulation shall to the extent that it is more favourable prevail over the present Treaty.</p>
        <p>(2) Each Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments in its territory by agreement with nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9">
        <p>The present Treaty shall also apply to investments made prior to its entry into force by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party consistent with the latter's legislation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10">
        <p>(1) Investment disputes between a Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party shall be settled, as far as possible, amicably between the parties to the dispute.</p>
        <p>(2) If the dispute is not settled within six months of the date of its notification by one of the parties, it shall, at the request of one of the parties, be submitted for arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965.</p>
        <p>(3) The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in the said Convention.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11">
        <p>(1) Divergencies between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of the present Treaty should as far as possible be settled by the Governments of the two Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>(2) If a divergency cannot thus be settled, it shall upon the request of either Contracting Party be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>(3) Such arbitral tribunal shall be constituted ad hoc as follows: each Contracting Party shall appoint one member, and these two members shall agree upon a national of a third State as their chairman to be appointed by the Governments of the two Contracting Parties. Such members shall be appointed within two months, and such chairman within three months from the date on which either Contracting Party has informed the other Contracting Party that it intends to submit the dispute to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>(4) If the periods specified in paragraph 3 above have not been observed, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other relevant arrangement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President should make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he, too, is prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the Court next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party should make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>(5) The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decisions by a majority of votes. Such decisions shall be binding. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own member and of its representatives in the arbitral proceedings; the cost of the chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. The arbitral tribunal may make a different regulation concerning costs. In all other respects, the arbitral tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
        <p>(6) If both Contracting Parties are members of the Convention of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States the arbitral tribunal provided for above may in consideration of the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 27 of the said Convention not be appealed to insofar as agreement has been reached between the national or company of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party under Article 25 of the Convention. This shall not affect the possibility of appealing to such arbitral tribunal in the event that a decision of the Arbitral Tribunal established under the said Convention (Article 27) is not complied with or in the case of an assignment under a law or pursuant to a legal transaction as provided for in Article 6 of the present Treaty.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="12">
        <p>The present Treaty shall remain in force also in the event of a conflict arising between the Contracting Parties, without prejudice to the right to take such temporary measures as are permitted under the general rules of international law. Such measures shall be repealed not later than on the date of the actual termination of the conflict, irrespective of whether or not diplomatic relations exist.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="13">
        <p>With the exception of the provisions in paragraph 6 of the Protocol, insofar as they refer to air transport, the present Treaty shall also apply to Land Berlin, provided that the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany does not make a contrary declaration to the Government of St. Lucia within three months of the date of entry into force of the present Treaty.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="14">
        <p>(1) The present Treaty shall be ratified; the instruments of ratification shall be exchanged as soon as possible in Castries.</p>

It shall remain in force for a period of ten years and shall be extended thereafter for an unlimited period except if denounced in writing by either Contracting Party twelve months before its expiration. After the expiry of the period of ten years the present Treaty may be denounced at any time by either Contracting Party giving one year's notice.</p>
        <p>(3) In respect of investments made prior to the date of termination of the present Treaty, the provisions of Articles 1 to 13 shall continue to be effective for a further period of twenty years from the date of termination of the present Treaty.</p>

      <p>On signing the Treaty concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, concluded between St. Lucia and the Federal Republic of Germany, the undersigned plenipotentiaries have, in addition, agreed on the following provisions which shall be regarded as an integral part of the said Treaty:</p>
      <p>(1) Ad Article 1</p>
      <p>(a) Returns from the investment, and, in the event of their re-investment, the returns therefrom, shall enjoy the same protection as the investment.</p>
      <p>(b) Without prejudice to any other method of determining nationality, in particular any person in possession of a national passport issued by the competent authorities of the Contracting Party concerned shall be deemed to be a national of that Party.</p>
      <p>(2) Ad Article 2</p>
      <p>Investments made, in accordance with the laws and regulations of either Contracting Party, within the area of application of the law of that Party by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party shall enjoy the full protection of the present Treaty.</p>
      <p>(3) Ad Article 3</p>
      <p>The following shall more particularly, though not exclusively, be deemed "activity" within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 3: the management, maintenance use and enjoyment of an investment. The following shall, in particular, be deemed "treatment less favourable" within the meaning of Article 3: restricting the purchase of raw or auxiliary materials, of energy or fuel or of means of production or operation of any kind, impeding the marketing of products inside or outside the country, as well as any other measures having similar effects. Measures that have to be taken for reasons of public security and order, public health or morality shall not be deemed "treatment less favourable" within the meaning of Article 3.</p>
      <p>(b) The Contracting Parties shall within the framework of their national legislation give sympathetic consideration to applications for the entry and sojourn of persons of either Contracting Party who wish to enter the territory of the other Contracting Party in connexion with the making and carrying through of an investment; the same shall apply to nationals of either Contracting Party who in connexion with an investment wish to enter the territory of the other Contracting Party and sojourn there to take up employment. Such entry shall however be subject to limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. Applications for work permits shall also be given sympathetic consideration.</p>
      <p>(c) It is understood that paragraphs 1 and 2 do not oblige a Contracting Party to extend to persons resident in the territory of the other Contracting Party tax privileges, tax exemptions and tax reductions which according to its tax laws are granted only to nationals and companies resident in its territory.</p>
      <p>(4) Ad Article 4</p>
      <p>(a) The term "value" used in Article 4 paragraph 2 means market value. If a market value cannot be determined, the value has to be determined by other criteria of value. If the parties cannot agree on the amount of compensation within three months the question shall be submitted to the Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for final settlement pursuant to the provisions of the Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States of 18 March 1965.</p>
      <p>(b) "Expropriation" shall mean any taking away or restricting tantamount to the taking away of any property right which in itself or in conjunction with other rights constitutes an investment.</p>
      <p>(c) A claim to compensation shall also exist when, as a result of State intervention in the company in which the investment is made, its economic substance is severely impaired.</p>
      <p>(5) Ad Article 7</p>
      <p>A transfer shall be deemed to have been made "without delay" within the meaning of paragraph 1 of Article 7 if effected within such period as is normally required for the completion of transfer formalities. The said period shall commence on the day on which the relevant request has been submitted and may on no account exceed two months.</p>
      <p>(6) Whenever goods or persons connected with the making of investments are to be transported, each Contracting Party shall neither exclude nor hinder transport enterprises of the other Contracting Party and shall issue permits as required to carry out such transport.</p>
      <p>This shall include the transport of</p>
      <p>(a) Goods directly intended for an investment within the meaning of the present Treaty or acquired in the territory of either Contracting Party or of any third State by or on behalf of an enterprise in which assets within the meaning of the present Treaty are invested;</p>
      <p>(b) Persons travelling in connexion with the making of investments.</p>
