      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="National treatment and most-favoured nation provisions">
        <p>(1)  Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject investments or returns of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to treatment less favourable than that which it accords to investments or returns of its own nationals or companies or to investments or returns</p>
        <p>Of nationals or companies of any third State.</p>
        <p>(2)  Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, as regard their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments, to treatment less favourable than that which it accords to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third State.</p>

Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation was publicly announced, whichever is the earlier, shall include interest at a normal commercial rate until the date of the payment, shall be made without delay, be effectively realisable and be freely transferable. Whenever there is no market, as a basis for determining the value of the investment, compensation shall be calculated on the basis of a fair evaluation of the value of the investment taking into account all relevant factors.
