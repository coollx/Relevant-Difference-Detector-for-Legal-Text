      <div type="article" num="10" title="Disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>(1) Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation and application of this Agreement should, as far as possible, be settled through direct and meaningful negotiations between the two Parties. If such a dispute cannot be settled within six months after the commencement of negotiations, then, upon the request of either Contracting Parties, the dispute shall be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>(2) Such an arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way:</p>
        <p>Within three months from the receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the tribunal. Those two members shall then select a national of a third State, who on approval by the Contracting Parties shall be appointed Chairman of the tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within three months from the date of appointment of the other two members. If within any of the periods specified the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make any necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he, too, is prevented from discharging the said function, the Member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of either Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>(3) The arbitral tribunal shall issue its decisions on the basis of the provisions of this Agreement and of other agreements concluded and effective between the Contracting Parties, as well as on the general principles and rules of international law.

        <p>(2) This Agreement shall remain in force for a period of ten years and shall continue in force thereafter unless, after the expiry of the initial period of ten years, either Contracting Party notifies in writing the other Contracting Party of its intention to terminate this Agreement. The Notice of termination shall become effective one year after it has been received by the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>(3) In respect of investments made until the date of expiry of the validity of the Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall continue in effect for a period of ten years, beginning with the date of its termination.</p>
