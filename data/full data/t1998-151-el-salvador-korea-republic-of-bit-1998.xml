        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investments and returns of investors of the other Contracting Party treatment which is fair and equitable and no less favorable than that which it accords to investments and returns of its own investors or to investments and returns of investors of any third State.</p>

        <p>(3) The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to investors of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from any international agreement on double taxation avoidance, free trade areas, customs unions, common markets or economic, monetary and similar unions.</p>
        <p>(4) Neither of the Contracting Parties can impose nor oblige the fulfillment of the following requirements or compromises, in relation to any investment in its territory:</p>

In both expropriation and compensation, treatment not less favorable than that which the Contracting Party accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State shall be accorded.
