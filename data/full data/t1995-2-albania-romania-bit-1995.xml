      <div type="article" num="3" title="Most favoured-nation and national treatment provisions">
        <p>1. Neither Contracting Party shall subject investments of the other Contracting Party to treatment less favourable than that which it accords to investments of its own investors or to investments of investors of any third State.</p>
        <p>2. Neither Contracting Party shall subject investors of the other Contracting Party, as regards their activity in connection with investments in its territory, to treatment less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State.</p>

Such compensation shall be equivalent to the market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the date on which the actual or impending expropriation, nationalization or comparable measure has been taken or become publicly known, whichever is earlier.</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Application">
        <p>This Agreement shall also apply to investments made prior to its entry into force, by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party consistent with the legislation of the latter Contracting Party.

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Settlement of disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1. Any dispute between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall, if possible, be settled amicably through diplomatic channels.</p>
        <p>2. If the dispute cannot thus be settled within six months from the beginning of the negotiations, it shall, upon the request of either Contracting Party, be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>3. The arbitral tribunal shall be constituted as follows:</p>
        <p>Each Contracting Party shall appoint one arbitrator and these two arbitrators shall agree upon a citizen of a third State as Chairman. The arbitrators shall be appointed within three months, the Chairman within five months from the date on which either Contracting Party has informed the other Contracting Party that it intends to submit the dispute to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>4. If one of the Contracting Parties fails to appoint its arbitrator and has not proceeded to do so within the specified period, the other Contracting Party may invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the two arbitrators are unable to reach an agreement, in the specified period, on the choice of the third arbitrator, either Contracting Party may invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5. If, in the cases provided for in the fourth paragraph of the present Article, the President of the International Court of Justice is prevented from exercising the said function, or is a citizen of either Contracting Party, the Vice President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice President is prevented from fulfiling of the said function or is a citizen of either Party, the most senior member of the Court available, who is not a citizen of either Party, shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>6. The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of International Law, including particularly the present Agreement and other relevant agreements existing between the two Contracting Parties, as well as the generally acknowledged rules and principles of International Law.</p>
        <p>7. Unless the contracting Parties decide otherwise, the tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>

        <p>9. Each contracting Party shall bear the costs of the arbitrator appointed by itself and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings. The cost of the Chairman as well as the other costs will be bom in equal parts by the Contracting Parties.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Settlement of disputes between an investor of one contracting party and the other contracting party">
        <p>1. Any dispute between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party concerning investments shall, as far as possible, be settled in an amicable way.</p>
        <p>2. If such dispute cannot be settled within six months from the date either party requested amicable settlement, the investor of the contracting Party concerned may submit the dispute at his choice, for settlement either to:</p>
        <p>a) The competent court of the contracting Party in the territory of which the investment has been made; or</p>
        <p>b) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) provided for by Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington, D.C., on 18 March 1965, if both Contracting Parties will become member to such Convention (untill that moment the Additional Facilities for the Administration of Conciliation, Arbitration and Fact-finding Proceedings are to be applied); or</p>
        <p>c) An ad-hoc international tribunal which, unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties to the dispute, shall be established under the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).</p>
        <p>3. Each Contracting Party hereby consents to the submission of an investment dispute to the international conciliation or arbitration.</p>
        <p>4. The Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute shall at no time whatsoever during the procedures involving investment disputes, assert as a defence its immunity or the fact that the investor has received compensation under an insurance contract covering the whole or part of the incurred damage or loss.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Application of other rules">
        <p>If the provisions of the legislation of either Contracting Party, or obligations under International Law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement contain a regulation, whether general or specific entitling investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than that provided for by the present Agreement, such regulation shall, to the extend that it is more favourable, prevail over the present Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="12" title="Consultations">
        <p>Representatives of the Contracting Parties shall, whenever necessary, hold consultations on any matter affecting the implementation of this Agreement. These consultations shall be held on the proposal of one of the Contracting Parties at a place and at a time agreed upon through diplomatic channels.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="13" title="Entry into force, duration, termination">
        <p>1. This Agreement shall enter into force thirty days after the date on which the Contracting Parties inform each other through diplomatic channels of its ratification or approval, according to their respective legislation. It shall remain in force for a period of 10 years.</p>
