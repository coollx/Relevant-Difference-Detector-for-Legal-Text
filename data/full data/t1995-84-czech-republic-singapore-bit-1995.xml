        <p>2. Any payment made by one Contracting Party (or any agency, institution, statutory body or corporation designated by it) to its nationals and companies shall not affect the right of such nationals and companies to make their claims against the other Contracting Party in accordance with Article 13.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="13" title="Investment disputes">
        <p>1.

Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitration proceedings and half the costs of the Chairman and the remaining costs. The tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the two Parties, and this award shall be binding on both Parties.</p>
        <p>8. Apart from the above the tribunal shall establish its own rules of procedure.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="15" title="Other obligations">
        <p>1. If the legislation of either Contracting Party or international obligations existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to this Agreement, result in a position entitling investments by nationals and companies of the other Contracting Party to treatment more favourable than is provided for by this Agreement such position shall not be affected by this Agreement.</p>
        <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall observe commitments, additional to those specified in this Agreement it has entered into with respect to the investments of the investors of the other Contracting Party. Each Contracting Party shall not interfere with any commitments, additional to those specified in this Agreement, entered into by its nationals or companies with the nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party as regards their investments.</p>
