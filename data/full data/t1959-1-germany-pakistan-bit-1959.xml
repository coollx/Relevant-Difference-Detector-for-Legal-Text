      <p>Excellency,</p>
      <p>It is our understanding that the term "investment" wherever it is used in this Treaty or in the letters annexed refers in respect of Pakistan to investments approved by the Government agencies authorizing such investments. If at any time later free investment is allowed in Pakistan the term "investment" will cover all investments made in the territory of Pakistan.</p>
      <p>The same term refers in respect of the Federal Republic of Germany to all investments made in accordance with its legislation.</p>
      <p>It is also our understanding that for the purpose of admission of capital investments the value of the assets mentioned in paragraph (1) of Article 8 may be determined by the appropriate agencies of the Party concerned.</p>
      <p>I shall be grateful if you would kindly confirm the above understanding.</p>
      <p>Accept, Excellency, the assurance of my highest consideration.</p>

      <p>I have the honor to confirm that you have received your letter of 25 November 1959, worded as follows:</p>
      <p>"It is our understanding that the term "investment" wherever it is used in this Treaty or in the letters annexed refers in respect of Pakistan to investments approved by the Government agencies authorizing such investments.

      <p>Excellency,</p>
      <p>During our discussion on the type and nature of treatment to be accorded by either Party to the nationals and companies of the other Party we realised that it would be neither desirable nor practicable to comprehend in this Treaty the extent and scope of favours and immunities which may be granted by either Party to the investments of nationals or companies of the other Party in specific cases. It was therefore agreed that without prejudice to the provisions of this Treaty any concessions that are granted by either Party to the nationals or companies of the other Party shall be governed by the documents of admission, namely the Memoranda or the Articles of Association established for the creation and operation of a particular enterprise or such other instruments as either Party may choose keeping in view the requirements of each case</p>
      <p>In admitting investments by nationals or companies of the other Party each Party may in the documents of admission mentioned above impose conditions regarding the administration, use or enjoyment of an investment or regarding the operation of an enterprise based on such investment or regarding the training and employment of nationals of the Party concerned. The favours and immunities mentioned in the first paragraph above and the conditions mentioned in the second paragraph above may fall outside the scope of national or most-favoured-nation treatment.</p>
