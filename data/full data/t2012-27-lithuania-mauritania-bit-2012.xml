    <preamble>
      <p>The Government of the Republic of Lithuania and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, hereinafter referred to as "the Contracting Parties",</p>
      <p>-  Desiring to intensify economic cooperation between them on mutually advantageous conditions,</p>
      <p>-  Determined to create favourable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party,</p>
      <p>-  Recognising that the promotion and protection of such investments will contribute to stimulate private business initiative and increase the prosperity of both countries,</p>
      <p>Have agreed as follows:</p>
    </preamble>
    <body>
      <div type="article" num="1" title="Definitions">
        <p>For the purposes of this Agreement:</p>
        <p>1.  The term "investment" shall comprise every kind of asset, invested by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the other Contracting Party, and shall include in particular, though not exclusively:</p>

        <p>e)  goodwill;</p>
        <p>f)  any right conferred by law or under contract, including concessions to search for, extract and exploit natural resources.</p>
        <p>Any alteration of the form in which assets are invested shall not affect their character as investment, provided such an alteration is made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the host Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>2.  The term "investor" shall mean:</p>
        <p>a)  natural persons who are nationals of that Contracting Party according to its laws and regulations;</p>
        <p>b)  any entity constituted under the laws and regulations of that Contracting Party;</p>
        <p>Who invest in the territory of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>3.  The term "returns" shall mean all amounts yielded by an investment and in particular, though not exclusively, includes profits, capital gains, interest, dividends, royalties and fees.</p>
        <p>4.

        <p>5.  The term "laws and regulations" shall mean the laws and regulations in force in the territory of the State of either Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion of investments">
        <p>1.  Each Contracting Party shall encourage investors of the other Contracting Party to make investments in its territory and shall admit such investments in accordance with its laws and regulations.</p>
        <p>2.  The Contracting Parties shall exchange, when necessary, information on investment opportunities in their territories, in order to help to identify the most profitable sectors for both Contracting Parties.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Protection and treatment of investments">
        <p>1.  Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party in its territory as well as their full security and protection.</p>
        <p>2.  Neither Contracting Party shall by arbitrary or discriminatory measures impair, de jure or de facto, the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>3.  Each Contracting Party shall accord to the investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party treatment no less favourable than that accorded to the investments made by its own investors or investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable.</p>
        <p>4.  The provisions of this Agreement shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to the investors of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege accorded to the investors of any third State by virtue of:</p>
        <p>a)  any existing or future customs union, common market, free trade area, other forms of regional economic cooperation or similar international arrangements to which either Contracting Party is or may become a party;</p>
        <p>b)  any existing or future agreements relating to avoidance of double taxation or any other arrangement relating to taxation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="Expropriation">
        <p>1.  Neither Contracting Party shall expropriate, nationalise or take measures having equivalent effect (hereinafter referred to as "expropriation") against investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, unless:</p>
        <p>a)  such expropriation is in the public interest and under due process of law,</p>
        <p>And</p>
        <p>b)  such expropriation is carried out without discrimination, and</p>
        <p>c)  prompt, adequate and effective compensation is given.</p>
        <p>2.  The compensation mentioned in point (c) of the paragraph (1) of this Article shall be equivalent to the market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation occurred or the impending expropriation became public knowledge. Such compensation shall be paid without delay. The compensation shall include interest calculated on the basis of the prevailing international market rate, from the date of expropriation until the date of full payment.</p>
        <p>3.  Investors, whose assets are being expropriated shall, without prejudice to their rights under Article 8 of this Agreement, have a right to prompt review by the appropriate judicial or other competent and independent authorities of the expropriating Contracting Party to determine whether such expropriation, and any related compensation conforms to the provisions of this Article and the laws and regulations of the expropriating Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Compensation for losses">
        <p>Investors of one Contracting Party who suffer losses relating to their investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party due to war, a state of national emergency, insurrection, riot or other similar events, shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party, treatment no less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Transfers">
        <p>1.  Each Contracting Party shall guarantee to investors of the other Contracting Party free transfer into and out of its territory of payments related to an investment, in particular:</p>
        <p>a)  initial capital and additional amounts for the maintenance or extension of the investment;</p>
        <p>b)  returns;</p>
        <p>c)  proceeds from total or partial liquidation of the investment;</p>
        <p>d)  funds in repayment of loans directly related to the investment;</p>
        <p>e)  compensation provided for in Articles 4 and 5;</p>
        <p>f)  payments under a guarantee or insurance contract referred to in Article 7;</p>
        <p>g)  earnings of personnel engaged from abroad in connection with an investment in its territory.</p>
        <p>2.  Without prejudice to measures adopted by the European Union, transfers shall be made in any freely convertible currency, at the applicable market rate of exchange prevailing on the date of transfer, and effected without delay.</p>
        <p>3.  The Contracting Parties shall accord to the transfers referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article treatment no less favourable than that accorded to transfers related to investors of any third State.</p>
        <p>4.  Either Contracting Party may maintain equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of measures, relating to taxation, protection of rights of creditors, or ensuring compliance with other laws and regulations.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If one Contracting Party or its designated agency ("the first Contracting Party") makes a payment under a guarantee or contract of insurance given in respect of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party ("the second Contracting Party"), the second Contracting Party shall recognise:</p>
        <p>a)  the assignment to the first Contracting Party by law or by legal transaction of all the rights and claims of the party indemnified, and</p>
        <p>b)  that the first Contracting Party is entitled to exercise such rights and enforce such claims by virtue of subrogation, to the same extent as the party indemnified.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Settlement of disputes between one contracting party and the investor of the other contracting party">
        <p>1.  Disputes between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party relating to an investment of the latter in the territory of the former shall, if possible, be settled amicably. In the event of a dispute the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made shall be notified in writing, by the investor.</p>
        <p>2.  If such a dispute cannot be settled amicably within six (6) months from the date of the written notification provided in paragraph 1, the investor shall be entitled to submit the dispute either to:</p>
        <p>-  Domestic judicial authority of the Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute, or to</p>
        <p>-  Arbitration by an ad hoc arbitral tribunal, established in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). The parties to the dispute may agree in writing to modify those Rules, or to</p>
        <p>-  The International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) established under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States.</p>
        <p>3.  Neither Contracting Party shall assert during the different phases of arbitration or enforcement as a defence that indemnification or other compensation for all or part of the alleged damage has been received or will be received pursuant to an insurance contract or a guarantee.</p>
        <p>4.  The awards of arbitration shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute. Each Contracting Party shall carry out without delay any such award, recognised in accordance with the laws and regulations of the respective Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Settlement of disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1.  Any dispute between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be settled through the diplomatic channels.</p>
        <p>2.  If the Contracting Parties cannot reach an agreement within six (6) months after the beginning of the dispute, the latter shall, upon the request of either Contracting Party, be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>3.  Such an arbitral tribunal referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be constituted in the following way. Within two months from the date on which either Contracting Party receives from the other Contracting Party a request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one arbitrator. These two arbitrators shall together, within a further two months period, select a third arbitrator who is a national of a third State. The third arbitrator, once approved by the two Contracting Parties, shall be appointed as Chairman of the arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>4.  If the arbitral tribunal has not been constituted within the periods specified in paragraph 3 of this Article, either Contracting Party may invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make any necessary appointments. If the President is a national of State of either Contracting Party, or is otherwise prevented from discharging this function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of State of either Contracting Party or if he also is prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of State of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5.  The arbitral tribunal shall determine its own procedure. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decisions by a majority of votes. The decisions shall be final and binding upon each Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>6.  Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of its own member of the arbitral tribunal and of its representation in the arbitration proceedings; the costs of the Chairman and remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. The arbitral tribunal may, however, decide that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the two Contracting Parties.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="More favourable provisions">
        <p>If the domestic law of the State of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law, existing at present or established hereafter, entitle investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to treatment more favourable than that provided by this Agreement, such more favourable treatment shall prevail.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Consultations">
        <p>Upon request by either Contracting Party, the other Contracting Party shall agree promptly to hold consultations on the interpretation or application of this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="12" title="Application of the agreement">
        <p>This Agreement shall apply to the investments made in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of the other Contracting Party prior to as well as after the entry into force of this Agreement, but shall not apply to any dispute concerning an investment which arose or could have arisen before its entry into force.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="13" title="Amendments">
        <p>This Agreement may be amended after its entry into force. Such amendments shall enter into force when the Contracting Parties have notified each other in writing that all their respective procedures for their entry into force have been completed.</p>
