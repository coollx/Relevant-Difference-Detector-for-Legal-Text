      <div type="article" num="4" title="National Treatment and Most Favoured Nation Treatment">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party treatment not less favourable than that which it accords to investments of its own investors or to investments of investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable.
