Investors of one Contracting Party who suffer losses relating to their investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party due to war, a state of national emergency, insurrection, riot or other similar events, shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party, treatment no less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable.</p>

        <p>3.  The Contracting Parties shall accord to the transfers referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article treatment no less favourable than that accorded to transfers related to investments made by investors of any third State.</p>

      <div type="article" num="7" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If one Contracting Party or its designated agency (the first Contracting Party) makes a payment under a guarantee or contract of insurance given in respect of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party ("the second Contracting Party"), the second Contracting Party shall recognise:</p>
        <p>a)  the assignment to the first Contracting Party by law or by legal transaction of all the rights and claims of the party indemnified, and</p>
        <p>b)  that the first Contracting Party is entitled to exercise such rights and enforce such claims by virtue of subrogation, to the same extent as the party indemnified.</p>

        <p>1.  Disputes between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party related to an investment of the latter in the territory of the former shall, if possible, be settled amicably. In the event of a dispute the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made shall be notified in writing, including detailed information, by the investor.</p>
        <p>2.  If such a dispute cannot be settled amicably within six months from the date of the written notification provided in paragraph 1, either party to the dispute, may submit it to:</p>
        <p>a)  the competent court of the Contracting Party; or/and</p>
        <p>b)  international arbitration to:</p>

        <p>4.  The awards of arbitration shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute. Each Contracting Party shall carry out without delay any such award, recognised in accordance with the laws and regulations of the respective Contracting Party and shall provide for its effective enforcement.</p>
        <p>5.  Neither Contracting Party shall assert as a defence that indemnification or other compensation for all or part of the alleged damage has been received or will be received pursuant to a guarantee or insurance contract.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Settlement of disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1.  Any dispute between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall, as far as possible, be settled through the diplomatic channels.</p>
        <p>2.  If the Contracting Parties cannot reach an agreement within six months after the beginning of the dispute, the latter shall, upon the request of either Contracting Party, be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>3.  Such an arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each case in the following way. Within two months from the date on which either Contracting Party receives from the other Contracting Party a request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one arbitrator. These two arbitrators shall together, within a further two months period, select a third arbitrator who is a national of a third State. The third arbitrator, once approved by the two Contracting Parties, shall be appointed as Chairman of the arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>4.  If the arbitral tribunal has not been constituted within the periods specified in paragraph 3 of this Article, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make any necessary appointments. If the President is a national of State of either Contracting Party, or is otherwise prevented from discharging this function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of State of</p>
        <p>Either Contracting Party or if he also is prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of State of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5.  The arbitral tribunal shall determine its own procedure. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decisions by a majority of votes. The decisions shall be final and binding upon each Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>6.  Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of its own member of the arbitral tribunal and of its representation in the arbitration proceedings; the costs of the Chairman and remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. The arbitral tribunal may, however, decide that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the two Contracting Parties and such award shall be binding on both Contracting Parties.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="More favourable provisions">
        <p>If the domestic law of the State of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law, existing at present or established hereafter, entitle investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to treatment more favourable than that provided by this Agreement, such more favourable treatment shall prevail.</p>

      <div type="article" num="11" title="Consultations">
        <p>Upon request by either Contracting Party, the other Contracting Party shall agree promptly to hold consultations on the interpretation or application of this Agreement.</p>
