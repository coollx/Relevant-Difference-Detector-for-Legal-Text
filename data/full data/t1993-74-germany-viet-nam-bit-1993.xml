        <p>In signing the Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam on the Claim and Reciprocal Protection of Capital Investments, the undersigned Plenipotentiaries also agreed on the following provisions, which shall be deemed to be integral parts of the Treaty:</p>
        <p>(1) Ad Article 1</p>
        <p>(a) The income from the investment and, in the case of reinvestment, the income therefrom, shall enjoy the same protection as the investment.</p>
        <p>(b) In particular, without prejudice to other procedures for determining nationality, any person holding a national passport issued by the competent authorities of a Contracting Party shall be deemed to be a national of that Party.</p>
        <p>(2) Ad Article 2</p>
        <p>The Treaty shall also apply in the territories of the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf to the extent that the national law of the respective Contracting Party permits the exercise of sovereign rights or powers in these territories.</p>
        <p>(3) Ad Article 3</p>
        <p>(a) For the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 3, "operation" shall mean in particular, but not exclusively, the management, use, enjoyment and enjoyment of a capital asset.  Each Contracting Party may, when authorizing the investment of a national or company of the other Contracting Party, lay down conditions different from those applicable to domestic nationals or companies. Such conditions, in particular any restrictions on supply, restrictions on sales and similar measures, may not be changed to the detriment of the national or company of the other Party after approval has been granted. Measures to be taken for reasons of public safety and order, public health or morality shall not be considered as "less favorable" treatment within the meaning of Article 3.</p>
        <p>(b) The provisions of Article 3 shall not apply to natural persons and companies resident in the territory of the other Party in so far as they concern tax benefits, exemptions and reductions which, according to the tax laws, are granted only to natural persons and companies resident in the territory of one Party.</p>
        <p>(c) The Contracting Parties shall, within the framework of their national legislation, give favorable consideration to applications for entry and residence of persons of one Contracting Party who wish to enter the territory of the other Contracting Party in connection with an investment of capital; the same shall apply to employees of one Contracting Party who wish to enter and reside in the territory of the other Contracting Party in connection with an investment of capital in order to carry on an activity as an employee.  Applications for work permits shall also be favorably considered.</p>
        <p>(4) Ad Article 4</p>
        <p>A claim for compensation shall also exist if the enterprise which is the subject of the capital investment is interfered with by government measures and its economic substance is thereby substantially impaired.</p>
        <p>(5) Ad Article 5</p>
        <p>In the event of exceptional balance of payments difficulties, the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam may, for a period not exceeding three years, restrict the free transfer of proceeds from a sale or liquidation of a capital investment in accordance with Article 5(d).  In this case, the transfer of 33&#xBD; percent of the total amount shall be guaranteed annually.</p>
        <p>At the request of the investor, the amount not transferred shall be credited to a foreign exchange account and shall bear interest at the bank's standard rate.</p>
        <p>(6) Ad Article 7</p>
        <p>For the purposes of Article 7, paragraph 1, a transfer shall be deemed to have been effected "without delay" if it is effected within a period of time that is normally required to comply with the formalities of the transfer. The period shall commence with the submission of a request to that effect and shall under no circumstances exceed two months.</p>
        <p>(7) In the case of claims by governments and persons in connection with a capital investment, a contracting party shall neither exclude nor hinder the transport companies of the other contracting party and, if necessary, grant permission for the transports to be carried out.  This shall include shipments of</p>
        <p>a) goods which are directly intended for investment within the meaning of the Treaty or which are acquired in the territory of a Contracting Party or of a third State by or on behalf of an enterprise in which assets within the meaning of the Treaty are invested;</p>
        <p>(b) persons traveling in connection with an investment.</p>
