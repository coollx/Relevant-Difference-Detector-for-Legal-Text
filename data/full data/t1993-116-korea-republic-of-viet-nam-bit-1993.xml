      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Settlement of Investment Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of the other Contracting Party">
        <p>(1) Any dispute between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party relating to an investment under this Agreement shall be settled amicably, as far as possible, by the parties to the dispute through consultation and negotiation.</p>
        <p>(2) The local remedies under the laws and regulations of one Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment has been made are available for the investor of the other Contracting Party on the basis of treatment not less favourable than that accorded to investments of its own investors or investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the investor.</p>
        <p>(3) If the dispute cannot thus be settled within six months from the date on which the dispute has been raised by either party, it shall be submitted upon request of the investor or the Contracting Party to International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature in Washington on 18 March 1965, in the event the Socialist Republic of Vietnam becomes a Party to this Convention. Until that moment the dispute shall be submitted to conciliation or arbitration procedure to be mutually agreed upon the basis of the Washington Convention.</p>

        <p>(3) The Arbitral Tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way. Within two(2) months of the receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint member of the Tribunal.

The Chairman shall be appointed within three(3) months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>(4) If within the periods specified in paragraph(3) of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, a request may be made to the President of the International Court of Justice to make the appointments. If he happens to be a national of either Contracting Party, or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the appointments. If the Vice-President also happens to be a national of either Contracting Party or is prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the appointments.</p>
        <p>(5) The Arbitral Tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be binding.
