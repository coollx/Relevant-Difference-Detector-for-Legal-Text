        <p>2. Neither Contracting Party shall subject nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, as regards their activity in connection with investments in its territory, to treatment less favourable than it accords to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third State.</p>

        <p>3.

Where the market value cannot be ascertained properly the compensation shall be determined in accordance with internationally recognised accounting principles. The compensation shall include interest at the current LIBOR rate from the date of expropriation until the date of payment.

Nationals and companies of a Contracting Party whose investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party suffer losses owing to war or other armed conflict, a state of national emergency, revolt, or riot in the territory of the latter Contracting Party shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party treatment not less favourable than that which the latter Contracting Party accords to his nationals and companies or to nationals and companies of any third country whichever is the most favourable as regards restitution, compensation or any other valuable consideration.</p>
        <p>2. Without prejudice to Paragraph 1 of this Article, nationals and companies of one Contracting Party who in any of the situations referred to in that Paragraph suffer damages or losses in the territory of the other contracting Party resulting from:</p>
        <p>(a) Requisitioning of their property by its forces or authorities, or</p>
        <p>(b) Destruction of their property by its forces or authorities which was not caused in combat action or was not required by the necessity of the situation, shall be accorded restitution or fair and adequate compensation.</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If either Contracting Party makes a payment to any of its nationals or companies under a guarantee it has assumed in respect of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party and if an investment in the territory of one Contracting Party is insured against non-commercial risks under a system established by law and a payment is made by an insurer under an indemnity given in respect of that investment, the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made shall, without prejudice to the rights of the former Contracting Party under Article 8, recognise the assignment to the former Contracting Party or the insurer as appropriate, whether under a law or pursuant to a legal transaction, of any right or claim of such national or company of the former Contracting Party. The latter Contracting Party shall also recognise the subrogation of the former Contracting Party or insurer to any such right or claim (assigned claims) which that Contracting Party or insurer shall be entitled to assert to the same extent as its predecessor in title.

        <p>4. If the periods specified in paragraph 3 above have not been observed either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other relevant arrangement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments.

Each Contracting Party herewith declares its acceptance of such arbitration procedure. Unless the parties in dispute have agreed otherwise, the provisions of Paragraphs 3 to 5 of Article 8 shall be applied mutatis mutandis on condition that the appointment of the members or the arbitration tribunal in accordance with Paragraph 3 of Article 8 is effected by the parties in dispute and that, insofar as the periods specified in Paragraph 3 of Article 8 are not observed, either party in dispute may, in the absence of other arrangements, invite the President of the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris to make the required appointments. The award shall be enforced in accordance with domestic law.</p>
        <p>3. During arbitration proceedings or the enforcement of an award, the Contracting Party involved in the dispute shall not raise the objection that the nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party have received compensation under an insurance contract in respect of all or part of its loss.</p>
        <p>4. In the event of both Contracting Parties having become Contracting States of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States of 18th March, 1965, disputes under this Article between the parties in dispute shall be submitted for arbitration under the aforementioned convention unless the parties in dispute agree otherwise, each Contracting Party hereby declares its acceptance of such a procedure.</p>

      <p>1. Ad Article 3</p>
      <p>(a) Measures undertaken by one Contracting Party in pursuit of its development objectives to stimulate the creation of industries in its territory and applied only to its nationals are not considered to be contrary to the obligations of Article 3, provided they do not substantially impair established and admitted investments of nationals and companies of the other Contracting Party. Measures that have been taken for reasons of public security and order, public health or morality shall not be deemed "treatment less favourable" within the meaning of Article 3.</p>
      <p>(b) The following shall more particularly, though not exclusively, be deemed "activity" within the meaning of Article 3(2): the management, main tenance, use and enjoyment of an investment. The following shall, in particular, be deemed &#x201E;treatment less favourable" within the meaning of Article 3: unequal treatment in the case of restrictions on the purchase of raw or auxiliary materials, of energy or fuel or of means of production or operation of any kind, unequal treatment in the case of impeding the market ing of products inside or outside the country, as well as any other measures having similar effects.</p>
      <p>(c) The provisions of Article 3 do not oblige a Contracting Party to extend to natural persons or companies resident in the territory of the other Contracting Party tax privileges, tax exemptions and tax reductions which according to its tax laws are granted only to natural persons and companies resident in its territory.</p>
      <p>D) The Contracting Parties shall within the framework of their national legislation give sympathetic consideration to applications for the entry and sojourn of persons of either Contracting Party who wish to enter the territory of the other Contracting Party in connection with an investment; the same shall apply to employed persons of either Contracting Party who in connection with an investment wish to enter the territory of the other Contracting Party and sojourn there to take up employment. Applications for work permits shall also be given sympathetic consideration.</p>
      <p>2. Whenever goods or persons connected with an investment are to be transported, each Contracting Party shall neither exclude nor hinder transport enterprises of the other Contracting Party and shall issue permits, in accordance with its laws and regulations, as required to carry out such transport.</p>
