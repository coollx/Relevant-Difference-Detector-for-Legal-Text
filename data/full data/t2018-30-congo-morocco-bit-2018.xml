        <p>Each Contracting Party shall accord in its territory to investors of the other Contracting Party, in respect of activities related to their investments, treatment no less favourable than that which it accords in like circumstances to its own investors or to investors of the most-favoured-nation, whichever is the more favourable to the investor concerned.</p>

Measures of nationalisation, expropriation or any other measure having the effect of dispossession (hereinafter referred to as expropriation) which may be taken by the authorities of one of the Contracting Parties against investments made by investors from the other Contracting Party shall not be discriminatory or motivated by reasons other than those of public interest. Expropriation measures must be carried out in accordance with the legal procedure.</p>
        <p>2. The Contracting Party which has taken such measures shall, without undue delay, pay the rightful owner compensation in an amount corresponding to the fair market value of the expropriated investment on the day before the expropriation measures are taken or made public, whichever occurs first.</p>

        <p>4. No Contracting Party, party to a dispute, may object at any stage of the arbitration proceedings or the enforcement of an arbitral award on the ground that the investor, the adverse party to the dispute, has received compensation covering all or part of its losses under an insurance policy.</p>
        <p>5. The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the national law of the Contracting Party, party to the dispute, in whose territory the investment is located, including rules relating to conflict of laws, the provisions of this Agreement, and the principles of international law.</p>
        <p>6. Arbitral awards shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute. Each Contracting Party undertakes to enforce such awards in accordance with its national law.</p>

        <p>2. If the ad hoc Joint Committee cannot settle the dispute within six (6) months of the start of negotiations, it shall be submitted to an arbitration tribunal at the request of one of the Contracting Parties.</p>

        <p>If the time limits laid down in paragraph (3) above have not been observed, either Contracting Party shall invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President of the International Court of Justice possesses the nationality of one of the Contracting Parties, or if he is prevented from holding that office, the Vice-President of the International Court of Justice shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of one of the Contracting Parties or if he is prevented from holding office, the senior member of the International Court of Justice who is not a national of any of the Contracting Parties shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5. The arbitral tribunal shall rule on the basis of the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and principles of International Law. The decision of the tribunal shall be adopted by a simple majority of votes. It shall be final and binding on the Contracting Parties.

        <p>6. The Tribunal shall lay down its own rules of procedure.</p>
        <p>7. Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of its arbitrator and of his representation in the arbitration proceedings. The costs relating to the Chairman and other costs shall be borne equally by the Contracting Parties.</p>
