      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion and admission of investments">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote, as far as possible, investments by investors of the other Contracting Party. Each Contracting Party shall admit such investments in accordance with its laws and regulations.</p>
        <p>2. When a Contracting Party shall have admitted an investment in its territory, it shall, in accordance with its laws and regulations, grant the necessary permits in connection with such an investment and with the carrying out of licensing agreements and contracts for technical, commercial or administrative assistance. Each Contracting Party shall endeavour to issue the necessary authorizations concerning the activities of consultants and other qualified persons, regardless of their nationality.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Protection">
        <p>1. Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security. In no case shall a Contracting Party accord to such investments treatment less favourable than that required by international law.</p>
        <p>2. Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of such investments. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into in writing with regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="National treatment and most favoured nation treatment">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall accord, in its territory, to investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party treatment no less favourable than that which it accords to the investments made by its own investors or by investors of any third State whichever is more favourable to the investor concerned.</p>
        <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall accord, in its territory, to investors of the other Contracting Party, as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments, treatment no less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State whichever is more favourable to the investor concerned.</p>
        <p>3. The treatment granted under paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to the investors of the other Contracting Party and their investments the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from:</p>
        <p>a) Its membership of, or association with, any existing or future free trade area, customs, economic or monetary union or other similar international agreements including other forms of regional economic organisation, or</p>
        <p>b) Any international agreement or arrangement relating wholly or mainly to taxation or any domestic legislation relating wholly or mainly to taxation.</p>
        <p>4. Measures that have to be taken for reasons of public security and order or public health shall not be deemed treatment "less favourable" within the meaning of this Article.</p>
        <p>5. Neither Contracting Party shall be precluded from designating, in accordance with its laws and regulations, a business or category of business as reserved for its own investors, provided that, with due regard to the provisions of Article 5, such designation</p>
        <p>a) Is made for the purpose of promoting small and medium-sized businesses only; and</p>
        <p>b) Shall not negatively affect the rights which at the time of the designation have already accrued to an investment or an investor of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Expropriation">
        <p>1. Investments of investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated or subjected to measures having equivalent effect to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as "expropriation") except for public interest, in accordance with due process of law, on a non discriminatory basis and against the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.</p>
        <p>2. Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation became publicly known, whichever is earlier (hereinafter referred to as the "valuation date").</p>
        <p>3. Such market value shall be expressed in a freely convertible currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing for that currency on the valuation date. Compensation shall include interest at a commercial rate established on a market basis for the currency of valuation from the date of expropriation until the date of payment. Compensation shall be paid without delay, be effectively realizable and freely transferable.</p>
        <p>4. The investor affected shall have the right, under the law of the Contracting Party making the expropriation, to prompt review, by a judicial authority or other competent authority of that Contracting Party, of its case, including the valuation of its investment and the payment of compensation, in accordance with the principles set out in this Article.</p>
        <p>5. Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its own territory, and in which investors of the other Contracting Party own shares, it shall ensure that the provisions of this Article are applied so as to guarantee prompt, adequate and effective compensation in respect of their investment to such investors of the other Contracting Party who are owners of those shares.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Compensation for losses">
        <p>1. Investors of one Contracting Party whose investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party suffer losses owing to war or to other armed conflict, state of national emergency, revolution, insurrection, civil disturbance or any other similar event, shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement, treatment no less favourable than that which the latter Contracting Party accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State whichever is more favourable to the investor concerned. Resulting payments shall be freely transferable.</p>
        <p>2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1), an investor of one Contracting Party who, in any of the situations referred to in that paragraph, suffers a loss in the territory of the other Contracting Party resulting from:</p>
        <p>a) Requisitioning of its investment or part thereof by the latter's forces or authorities; or</p>
        <p>b) Destruction of its investment or part thereof by the latter's forces or authorities, which was not required by the necessity of the situation,</p>
        <p>Shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party restitution or compensation which in either case shall be prompt, adequate and effective. Resulting payments shall be made without delay and be freely transferable.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Transfers">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall guarantee to investors of the other Contracting Party the free transfer of all payments relating to their investments. Such transfers shall include, in particular, though not exclusively:</p>
        <p>a) The initial capital and additional amounts to maintain or increase the investment;</p>
        <p>b) Investment returns, as defined in Article 1;</p>
        <p>c) Funds in repayment of loans related to an investment;</p>
        <p>d) Compensations provided for under Articles 5 and 6;</p>
        <p>e) Proceeds from the total or partial sale or liquidation of an investment;</p>
        <p>f) Earnings and other remuneration of personnel engaged from abroad in connection with an investment;</p>
        <p>g) Payments arising out of the settlement of a dispute.</p>
        <p>2. Transfers under the present Agreement shall be made without delay in a freely convertible currency at the market rate of exchange applicable on the date of transfer.</p>
        <p>3. In the case of exceptional balance of payments difficulties, either Contracting Party is entitled, for a maximun of three years, to limit, in an equitable and non discriminatory manner and in good faith, the free transfer of the proceeds from the sale or liquidation of an investment of the nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party and to prescribe transfer by instalments. At the investor's request, amounts not transferred shall be paid into an account in convertible currency and shall accrue interest at the rate quoted on the international market for the currency concerned.</p>
        <p>4. Notwithstanding the provisions of the above mentioned paragraphs 1 and 2, each Contracting Party may delay or prevent a transfer through the equitable, non discriminatory and good faith application of measures:</p>
        <p>a) To protect the rights of the creditors;</p>
        <p>b) To ensure the compliance with judgements concerning criminal or penal offences;</p>
        <p>c) To comply with administrative decisions and judicial sentences;</p>
        <p>Provided that such measures and their application shall not be used as means of avoiding the commitments or obligations of the contracting Party under this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Application of other provisions">
        <p>1. If the legislation of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to this Agreement contain a regulation, whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than that provided for by this Agreement, such regulation shall, to the extent that it is more favourable, prevail over this Agreement.</p>
        <p>2. More favourable terms than those of this Agreement which have been agreed to by one of the Contracting Parties with investors of the other Contracting Party shall not be affected by this Agreement.</p>
        <p>3. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the provisions established by international Agreements relating to the intellectual and industrial property rights in force at the date of its signature.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If one Contracting Party or its designated Agency makes a payment under an indemnity, guarantee or contract of insurance against non-commercial risks given in respect of an investment made by any of its investors in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall recognize the assignment of any right or claim of such investor to the former Contracting Party or its designated Agency and the right of the former Contracting Party or its designated Agency to exercise, by virtue of subrogation, any such right and claim to the same extent as its predecessor in title. This subrogation will make it possible for the former Contracting Party or its designated Agency to be the direct beneficiary of any payment for indemnification or other compensation to which the investor could be entitled.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Settlement of disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1. Any dispute between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall as far as possible be settled through diplomatic channels.</p>
        <p>2. If it were not possible to settle the dispute in this way within six months from the start of the negotiations, it shall be submitted, at the request of either of the two Contracting Parties, to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>3. The arbitral tribunal shall be set up in the following way: each Contracting Party shall appoint one arbitrator and these two arbitrators shall elect a national of a third country as Chairman. The arbitrators shall be appointed within three months and the Chairman within five months from the date on which either of the two Contracting Parties informed the other Contracting Party of its intention to submit the dispute to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>4. If within the periods specified in paragraph 3 of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he too is prevented from discharging the said function, the Member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5. The arbitral tribunal shall issue its decision on the basis of the provisions contained in this Agreement as well as the generally accepted principles of international law.</p>
        <p>6. Unless the Contracting Parties decide otherwise, the arbitral tribunal shall lay down its own procedure.</p>
        <p>7. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes and that decision shall be final and binding on both Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>8. Each Contracting Party shall bear the expenses of its own arbitrator and those connected with representing it in the arbitration proceedings. The other expenses, including those of the Chairman, shall be borne in equal parts by the two Contracting Parties.</p>

As long as a Contracting Party which is party in the dispute has not become a Contracting State of the Convention mentioned above, the dispute shall be dealt with pursuant to the rules of the Additional Facility for the Administration of Conciliation, Arbitration and Fact-Finding Proceedings of the ICSID.</p>
        <p>3. The arbitration shall be based on the provisions of this Agreement, the national law of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made, including the rules relative to conflicts of law, and the rules and generally accepted principles of international law as may be applicable.</p>
        <p>4. A Contracting Party shall not assert as a defence that indemnification or other compensation for all or part of the alleged damages has been received or will be received by the investor pursuant to a guarantee or insurance contract.</p>
        <p>5. The arbitration decisions shall be final and binding on the parties in the dispute. Each Contracting Party undertakes to execute the decisions in accordance with its national law.</p>
