        <p>In order to carry out the transfers, the tax obligations established by the legislation in force in the Contracting Party receiving the investment shall be observed.</p>
        <p>The Contracting Parties undertake to facilitate the procedures necessary to effect such transfers without undue delay or restrictions. In particular, no more than two months shall elapse from the date on which the investor has duly submitted the applications necessary to effect the transfer until such time as the transfer is actually effected.

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="VIII" title="More Favourable Conditions">

        <p>In the event that a Contracting Party has granted any financial guarantee for non-commercial risks in connection with an investment made by an investor of that Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter shall accept an application of the principle of subrogation of the former Contracting Party in the economic rights of the investor and not in the rights in rem, as soon as the latter has made a first payment under the guarantee granted.</p>
        <p>Such subrogation shall make it possible for the first Contracting Party to be the direct beneficiary of all compensation payments to which the original investor may be entitled. In no case may there be a subrogation in rights of ownership, use, enjoyment or any other real right derived from the ownership of the investment without the prior obtaining of the pertinent authorizations in accordance with the legislation on foreign investments in force in the Contracting Party where the investment was made.</p>

        <p>The national law of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment has been made, including the rules relating to conflicts of law.</p>
        <p>The generally accepted rules and principles of international law.</p>
