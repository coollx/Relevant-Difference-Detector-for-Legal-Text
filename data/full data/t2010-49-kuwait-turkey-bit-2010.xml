        <p>(a)  only the disputes arising directly out of investment activities which have obtained necessary permission, if any, in conformity with the relevant legislation of the Republic of Turkey on foreign capital, and that effectively started shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) or any other international dispute settlement mechanism as agreed upon by the Contracting Parties;</p>
        <p>(b)  the disputes, related to the property and real rights upon the real estate are totally under the jurisdiction of the Contracting Party where the investment is made and therefore, shall not be submitted to jurisdiction of the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) or any other international dispute settlement mechanism.</p>
        <p>5.  The arbitration awards shall be final and binding for all parties in dispute. Each Contracting Party commits itself to execute the award according to its national law.</p>
        <p>6.  In any proceedings, judicial, arbitral or otherwise or in an enforcement of any decision or award, concerning an investment dispute between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, a Contracting Party shall not assert, as a defense, its sovereign immunity. At any stage of the arbitration proceedings or of the execution of an arbitral award, none of the Contracting Parties involved in a dispute shall be entitled to raise as an objection the fact that the investor who is the opposing party in the dispute has received compensation totally or partly covering his losses pursuant to an indemnity or guarantee provided in Article 7 of this Agreement. A dispute shall, however, not be submitted to international arbitration by the Indemnifying Party under the provisions of this Article, if the same dispute has been brought before international arbitration by the investor.</p>

      <div type="article" num="9" title="Settlement of disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1.

In this regard, the Contracting Parties agree to engage in direct and meaningful negotiations to arrive at such solutions.

        <p>5.  The tribunal shall have three (3) months from the date of the selection of the Chairman to agree upon rules of procedure consistent with the other provisions of this Agreement. In the absence of such agreement, the tribunal shall request the President of the International Court of Justice to designate rules of procedure, taking into account generally recognized rules of international arbitral procedure.</p>
        <p>6.  The arbitral tribunal shall take its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be made in accordance with this Agreement and such recognized rules of international law as may be applicable and shall be final and binding on both Contracting Parties. Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of the member of the arbitral tribunal appointed by that Contracting Party, as well as the costs for its representation in the arbitration proceedings. The expenses of the Chairman as well as any other costs of the arbitration proceedings shall be borne in equal parts by the two Contracting Parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may, at its discretion, direct that a higher proportion or all of such costs be paid by one of the Contracting parties. In all other respects, the arbitral tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
        <p>7.  A dispute shall not be submitted to an international arbitration court under the provisions of this Article, if the same dispute has been brought before another international arbitration court under the provisions of Article 8 and is still before the court.</p>
