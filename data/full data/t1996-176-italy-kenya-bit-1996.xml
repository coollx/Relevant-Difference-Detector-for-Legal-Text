        <p>8. "Nondiscriminatory treatment" means treatment that is at least as favourable as the national treatment or most-favoured-nation treatment.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion and protection of investments">
        <p>1. Both Contracting Parties shall encourage investors of the other Contracting Party to invest in their territory.</p>
        <p>2. Investors of one of the Contracting Parties shall have the right of access to the investment activities, in the territory of the other Contracting Party, not less favourable than the one granted as per Article 3.1.Article 3.1.</p>

Both Contracting Parties shall ensure that the management, maintenance, use, transformation, enjoyment or assignment of the investments effected in their territory by investors of the other Contracting Party, as well as companies and enterprises in which these investments have been effected, shall in no way be subject to unjustified or discriminatory measures.</p>
        <p>4. Each Contracting Party shall create and maintain, in its territory a legal framework apt to assure to investors the continuity of legal treatment, including the compliance, in good faith, of all undertakings assumed with regard to each specific investor.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="National treatment and the most favoured nation clause">
        <p>1. Both Contracting Parties, within the boundaries of their own territory, shall offer investments effected by, and the income accruing to, investors of the other Contracting Party no less favourable treatment than that accorded to investments effected by, and income accruing to, its own nationals or investors of Third States.</p>
        <p>2. If provisions in the legislation of a Contracting Party, or in international agreements in force or which may come into force in the future for that Contracting Party, should accord to investors of the other Contracting Party more favourable treatment than foreseen in this Agreement, such provisions shall, to the extent that they are more favourable to the investor concerned, prevail over this Agreement. This principle shall also apply to existing investments.</p>
        <p>3. The provisions under point 1 and 2 of this Article do not refer to the advantages and privileges which one Contracting Party may grant to investors of Third States by virtue of their membership of a Customs or Economic Union, of a Common Market, of a Free Trade Area, of a multilateral economic Agreement or under agreements signed in order to prevent double taxation or to facilitate cross border trade.</p>
      </div>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Nationalization or expropriation">
        <p>1. The investments to which this Agreement relates shall not be subject to any measure which might limit the right of ownership, possession, control or enjoyment of the investments, permanently or temporarily, save where specifically provided by current, national or local, legislation or regulations and orders handed down by Courts or Tribunals having jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>2. Investments of investors of one of the Contracting Parties shall not be, "de jure" or "de facto", directly or indirectly nationalized, expropriated, requisitioned or subjected to any measures having an equivalent effect in the territory of the other Contracting Party, except for public purposes or national interest and in exchange for immediate, full and effective compensation, and on condition that these measures are taken on a non-discriminatory basis and in conformity with all legal provisions and procedures.</p>
        <p>3. The just compensation shall be established on the basis of real market value immediately prior to the moment in which the decision to nationalize or expropriate is announced or made public. In the absence of an understanding between the host Contracting Party and the investor during the nationalization or expropriation procedure, compensation shall be based on the same reference parameters and exchange rates taken into account in the documents for the constitution of the investment.</p>
        <p>The exchange rate applicable to any such compensation shall be that prevailing on the date immediately prior to the moment in which the nationalization or expropriation has been annonced or made public.</p>
        <p>4. Without restricting the scope of the above paragraph, should the object of nationalization, expropriation, or similar event be a company any part of whose share capital shall have been subscribed by an investor in a foreign currency or denominated in a foreign currency, the evaluation of the share of such investor will be in the currency of the investment, increased by capital increases, revaluation of capital, undistributed profits and reserves and diminished by the value of capital reductions and losses.</p>
        <p>5. Compensation will be considered as actual if it will have been paid in the same currency in which the investment has been made by the foreign investor, in as much as such currency is &#x2014; or remains &#x2014; convertible, or, otherwise, in any other currency accepted by the investor.</p>
        <p>6. Compensation will be considered as timely if it takes place without undue delay and, in any case, within six months.</p>
        <p>7. Compensation shall include interests calculated on LIBOR basis from the date of nationalization or expropriation to the date of payment.</p>
        <p>8. A national or company of either Party that asserts that all or part of its investment has been expropriated shall have a right to prompt review by the appropriate judicial or administrative authorities of the other Party to determine whether any such expropriation, and any compensation thereof, conforms to principles of international law, and to decide all other matters relating thereto.</p>
        <p>9. If, after the dispossession, the assets concerned have not been utilized, wholly or partially, for that purpose, the owner or his assignees are entitled to the repurchasing of the assets at the market price.</p>

        <p>b) Any income derived from an investment;</p>

Without restricting the scope of Article 3 of this Agreement, the Contracting Parties undertake to apply to the transfers mentioned in paragraph 1. of this Article the same favourable treatment that is accorded to investments effected by investors of Third States, in case it is more favourable.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Subrogation">
        <p>In the event that one Contracting Party or an Institution thereof has provided a guarantee in respect of non-commercial risks for investment effected by one of its investors in the territory of the other Contracting Party, and has effected payment to said investor on the basis of that guarantee, the other Contracting Party shall recognise the assignment of the rights of the investor to the first-named Contracting Party. In relation to the transfer of payments to the Contracting Party or its Institution by virtue of this assignment, the provisions of Article 4, 5 and 6 of this Agreement shall apply.</p>

        <p>3. In the event that such dispute cannot be settled amicably within six months of the date of the written application for settlement, the investor in question may submit at his choice the dispute for settlement to:</p>

        <p>3. The Arbitration Tribunal shall be constituted in the following manner: within two months from the moment on which the request for arbitration is received, each of the two Contracting Parties shall appoint a member of the Tribunal.
