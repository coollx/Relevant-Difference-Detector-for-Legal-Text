      <p>To the Agreement</p>
      <p>Between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments</p>
      <p>The Federal Republic of Germany and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan have agreed on the following provisions to the Agreement of 13 November 2007 concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments:</p>
      <p>(1)  Ad Article 1</p>
      <p>a)  Invested indirectly means invested by an investor of one Contracting Party through a company which is fully or partially owned by the investor and having its seat in the territory of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      <p>b)  Returns from an investment, as well as returns from re-invested returns, shall enjoy the same protection as the original investment.</p>
      <p>c)  Without prejudice to any other method of determining nationality, any person in possession of a national passport issued by the appropriate authorities of either Contracting Party shall be deemed to be a national of that Party.</p>
      <p>(2)  Ad Article 2</p>
      <p>The Agreement shall also apply to the areas of the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf insofar as international law permits the Contracting Party concerned to exercise sovereign rights or jurisdiction in these areas.</p>
      <p>(3)  Ad Article 3</p>
      <p>a)  The following shall more particularly, though not exclusively, be deemed activity within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 3: the management, maintenance, use, and enjoyment of an investment. The following shall, in particular, be deemed treatment less favourable within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 3: unequal treatment in the case of restricting the purchase of raw or auxiliary materials, of power or fuel or of means of production or operation of any kind, impeding the marketing of products inside or outside the country, as well as any other measures having similar effects. Measures that have to be taken for reasons of public security and order, public health or morality shall not be deemed treatment less favourable within the meaning of Article 3.</p>
      <p>b)  The provisions of Article 3 do not oblige a Contracting Party to extend to investors resident in the territory of the other Contracting Party tax privileges, tax exemptions and tax reductions which according to its tax laws are granted only to investors resident in its territory.</p>
      <p>c)  The Contracting Parties shall within the framework of their national legislation give sympathetic consideration to applications for the entry and sojourn of persons of either Contracting Party who wish to enter the territory of the other Contracting Party in connection with an investment; the same shall apply to employed persons of either Contracting Party who in connection with an investment wish to enter the territory of the other Contracting Party and sojourn there to take up employment. Applications for work permits shall also be given sympathetic consideration.</p>
      <p>(4)  Ad Article 7</p>
      <p>A transfer shall be deemed to have been made without delay within the meaning of paragraph 1 of Article 7 if made within such period as is normally required for the completion of transfer formalities. The said period shall commence on the day on which the relevant request has been submitted and may on no account exceed two months.</p>
      <p>(5)  Whenever goods or persons connected with the making of investments are to be transported, either Contracting Party shall neither exclude nor hinder transportation enterprises of the other Contracting Party and shall issue permits as required to carry out such transports. This includes the transportation of</p>
      <p>a)  goods directly intended for an investment within the meaning of the present Agreement or acquired in the territory of either Contracting Party or of any third State by or on behalf of an enterprise in which assets within the meaning of the present Agreement are invested;</p>
      <p>b)  persons travelling in connection with the making of investments.</p>
