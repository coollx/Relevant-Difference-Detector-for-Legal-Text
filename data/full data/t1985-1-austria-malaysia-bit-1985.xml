        <p>(2) All investments made by nationals or companies of one of the Contracting Parties shall enjoy fair and equitable treatment in the territory of the other Contracting Party.

        <p>(3) The provision of this Agreement relative to the grant of treatment no less favourable than that accorded to investments of nationals and companies of any third State shall not be construed as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to the nationals and companies of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from:</p>
        <p>(a) Any existing or future customs union, common market, free trade area, or regional economic organization of which either Contracting Party is or may become a member;</p>

The measures of expropriation shall be determined by due process of law in the territory of the Contracting Party in which the investment has been expropriated.</p>
        <p>(2) If any national or any company of one of the Contracting Parties has a predominant interest in a juridical person, organization or association with or without legal personality in a third country, paragraph (1) of this Article will also apply to this investor of the one Contracting Party, if the other Contracting Party expropriates investments of the juridical person, organization or association of the third country. The provisions referring to the compensation will apply, however, only if the juridical person, organization or association of the third country or the third country itself has no right to claim such compensation or if the third country has renounced such a right.</p>
        <p>(3) Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is considered as its own company pursuant to paragraph (2) of Article 1 of this Agreement, and in which nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party own shares, it shall apply the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article so as to ensure due compensation to these nationals or companies.</p>
        <p>(4) Nationals or companies of one Contracting Party whose investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party suffer losses owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency, revolt, insurrection or riot in the territory of the latter Contracting Party shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party treatment, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement, no less favourable than that which the latter Contracting Party accords to nationals or companies of any third State.</p>

        <p>(4) The rates of exchange and bank charges shall be determined by the respective banking system in the territory of each of the Contracting Parties and such rates and bank charges shall be fair and equitable.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Subrogation">
        <p>(1) Where one Contracting Party, or any public institution of the said Contracting Party, has granted a financial security against non-commercial risks in respect of an investment by nationals or companies in the territory of the other Contracting Party and payment has been made by the first Contracting Party or any public institution of this Party to its nationals or companies, the other Contracting Party shall recognize the rights of the first Contracting Party or any public institution of such Contracting Party by virtue of the principle of subrogation to the rights of the investor.</p>
        <p>(2) Any such payment made by one Contracting Party, or any public institution of the said Contracting Party, to its nationals or companies in pursuance of this Agreement shall not affect the right of the nationals or companies to take proceedings to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes in accordance with Article 9 of this Agreement, nor shall it affect the right of the said nationals or companies to carry on the proceedings until the disputes are settled.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Other obligations">
        <p>In the event of any matter being provided in this Agreement being provided as well in the national legislation of either of the Contracting Parties, no provision of this Agreement shall prevent nationals or companies of either of the Contracting Parties who possess investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party from availing themselves of the more favourable provisions.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Special agreement">
        <p>Investment effected as a result of a special agreement between either Contracting Party and the investors of the other Contracting Party shall be governed by the provisions of this Agreement as well as by the provisions of the said special agreement, whichever are more favourable for the investor.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Settlement of investment disputes">
        <p>(1) Any dispute arising directly out of an investment, between either Contracting Party and a national or a company of the other Contracting Party shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably between the parties to the dispute.</p>
        <p>(2) If any such dispute cannot be so settled within three months of a written notification of sufficiently detailed claim, the dispute shall upon the request of either Contracting Party or of the nationals or companies of either of the Contracting Parties be submitted for conciliation or arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between states and nationals of other states, opened for signature at Washington on 18th March, 1965. For this purpose, each Contracting Party, by this Agreement irrevocably consents in advance to submit any such disputes to this Centre. This consent implies renunciation of the requirement that the internal administrative or juridical resorts should be exhausted.</p>
        <p>(3) A Contracting Party which is a party to a dispute shall not, at any stage of conciliation or arbitration proceedings or enforcement of an award, raise as an objection the fact that the national or companies which are the other party to the dispute have received in pursuance of an insurance policy an indemnity in respect of some or all of its losses.</p>
        <p>(4) Each Contracting Party shall ensure the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards in accordance with its relevant laws and regulations.</p>

        <p>(2) If any such dispute cannot be so settled, it shall upon the request of either Contracting Party be submitted to arbitration. The arbitral tribunal (hereinafter called "the tribunal") shall consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by each Contracting Party and the third, who shall be the Chairman of the tribunal, appointed by agreement of the Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>(3) Within two months of receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one arbitrator, and within two months of such appointment of the two arbitrators, the Contracting Parties shall appoint the third arbitrator.</p>
        <p>(4) If the tribunal shall not have been constituted within four months of receipt of the request for arbitration, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is unable to do so, the Vice-President may be invited to do so. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is unable to do so, the Member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party may be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>(5) The tribunal shall establish its own rules of procedure.</p>
        <p>(6) The tribunal's decision shall be final and the Contracting Parties shall abide by and comply with the terms of its award. Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs resulting from the appointment of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitration proceedings; the costs resulting from the appointment of the office of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. The tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the two parties, and this award shall be binding on both Parties.</p>
