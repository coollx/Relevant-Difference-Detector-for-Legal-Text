      <div type="article" num="7" title="Settlement of investment disputes between a contracting party and an investor">
        <p>1. Any dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of that investor in the territory of the former Contracting Party shall be settled, as far as possible, amicably by consultations and negotiations between the parties to the dispute.</p>
        <p>2. If any such dispute should arise and cannot be resolved, amicably or otherwise, within six months from written notification of the existence of the dispute, then the investor affected may institute conciliation or arbitration proceedings by addressing a request to that effect to the Secretary-General of the Centre, as provided in Article 28 or 36 respectively of the Convention. The Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute shall not raise as an objection at any stage of the proceedings or enforcement of an award the fact that the investor which is the other party to the dispute has received, in pursuance of an insurance contract, an indemnity in respect of some or all of his or its losses.</p>
        <p>3. In event the investor chooses the Centre, each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter and hereinabove: the "Centre") for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965, any legal dispute arising between that Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter in the territory of the former.</p>

A company which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in the territory of one Contracting Party and in which, before such a dispute arises, the majority of shares are owned by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party shall, in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, be treated for the purposes of the Convention as a company of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>5. Neither Contracting Party shall pursue, through the diplomatic channel, any dispute referred to the Centre, unless:</p>
        <p>Conciliation commission or an arbitral tribunal constituted by it decides that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre; or (b)  the other Contracting Party should not comply with any award rendered by an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>6. All arbitral awards of the Centre shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute.</p>
        <p>7. All sums received as a result of a settlement shall be freely transferable.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1. Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement should, if possible, be settled through the diplomatic channel, which may include, if both Parties so desire, referral to a Bilateral Commission composed of representatives of both Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>2. If a dispute between the Contracting Parties cannot thus be settled within six (6) months from notification of the dispute, it shall, upon the request of either Contracting Party, be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>3. Such an arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way: Within two months of the receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the tribunal. Those two members shall then, with the approval of both Contracting Parties, select a national of a third State, who, on approval by the two Contracting Parties, shall be appointed Chairman of the tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>4. If, within the periods specified in paragraph (3) of this Article, the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris (hereinafter: the "ICC") to make any necessary appointments. If the President is prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is prevented from discharging the said function, the Member of the ICC next in seniority shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be binding on both Contracting Parties. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings; the cost of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. The tribunal may, however, in its decision, direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the two Contracting Parties and this award shall be binding on both Contracting Parties. The tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If one Contracting Party or its designated Agency (hereinafter: the "First Contracting Party") makes a payment under an indemnity given in respect of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party (hereinafter: the "Second Contracting Party"), the Second Contracting Party shall recognize:</p>
        <p>(a) The assignment to the First Contracting Party by law or by legal transaction of all the rights and claims of the party indemnified and that the First Contracting Party is entitled to the same treatment in respect of the rights and claims as the party indemnified; and</p>
        <p>(b) That the First Contracting Party is entitled to exercise such rights and enforce such claims by virtue of subrogation, and to any payments received in pursuance of such rights and claims, to the same extent as the party indemnified.</p>
        <p>Any payments received in non-convertible currency by the First Contracting Party, in pursuance of the rights and claims acquired, shall be freely available to the First Contracting Party for the purpose of meeting any expenditure incurred in the territory of the Second Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Application of other rules">
        <p>If the provisions of law of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement contain rules whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favorable than is provided for by the present Agreement, such rules shall to the extent that they are more favorable prevail over the present Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Entry into force">
        <p>Each Contracting Party shall notify the other Contracting Party of the completion of the procedures required for bringing this Agreement into force. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the latter notification.</p>
