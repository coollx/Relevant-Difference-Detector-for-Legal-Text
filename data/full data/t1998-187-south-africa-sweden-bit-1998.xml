    </title>
    <preamble>
      <p>The Kingdom of Sweden and the Republic of South Africa (hereinafter referred to as the "Contracting Parties"),</p>
      <p>DESIRING to intensify economic cooperation to the mutual benefit of both countries and to maintain fair and equitable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party;</p>
      <p>RECOGNISING that the promotion and reciprocal protection of such investments favour the expansion of the economic relations between the two Contracting Parties and stimulate investment initiatives;</p>
      <p>HAVE AGREED as follows:</p>
    </preamble>
    <body>
      <div type="article" num="1" title="Definitions">
        <p>In this Agreement, unless the context otherwise indicates:</p>
        <p>(1) "investment" shall mean any kind of asset, invested by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, provided that the investment has been made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the other Contracting Party, and shall include in particular, though not exclusively -</p>
        <p>(a) Movable and immovable property as well as any other right in rem such as mortgage, lien, pledge and usufruct;</p>
        <p>(b) Shares and other kinds of interest in companies;</p>
        <p>(c) Claims to money or any performance having an economic value;</p>
        <p>(d) Intellectual property rights, technical processes, trade names, know-how, goodwill and other similar rights; and</p>
        <p>(e) Business concessions conferred by law, administrative decisions or under contract, including concessions to search for, develop, extract or exploit natural resources.</p>
        <p>A change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect their character as investments. Goods, that under a leasing agreement are placed at the disposal of a lessee in the territory of one Contracting Party by a lessor being an investor of the other Contracting Party, shall be treated no less favourably than an investment. (2) "investor" shall mean -</p>
        <p>(a) Any natural person who is a national of a Contracting Party in accordance with its laws;</p>
        <p>(b) Any legal person constituted in the territory of a Contracting Party and having its seat in the territory of that Contracting Party; and</p>
        <p>(c) Any legal person not established under the laws of a Contracting Party but effectively controlled by natural persons, as defined in (a) above, or by legal persons, as defined in (b) above.</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion and Protection of Investments">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall, subject to its general policy in the field of foreign investment, promote in its territory investments by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall admit such investments in accordance with its laws.</p>
        <p>(2) Subject to the laws relating to the entry and sojourn of aliens, individuals working for an investor of one Contracting Party, as well as members of their household, shall be permitted to enter into, remain on and leave the territory of the other Contracting Party for the purpose of carrying out activities associated with investments in the territory of the latter Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>(3) In order to create favourable conditions for assessing the financial position and results of activities related to investments in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties, that Contracting Party shall notwithstanding its own national requirements for bookkeeping and auditing permit the investment to be subjected also to bookkeeping and auditing according to standards which the investor is subjected to by his national requirements or according to internationally accepted standards (e.g. International Accounting Standards (IAS) drawn up by the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC)). The result of such accountancy and audit shall be freely transferable to the investor.</p>
        <p>(4) The investments made in accordance with the laws of the Contracting Party in whose territory they are undertaken, shall enjoy the full protection of this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Treatment of Investments">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall apply to investments made in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party treatment which is no less favourable than that accorded to investments made by its own investors or by investors of third States, whichever is the more favourable.</p>
        <p>(2) Each Contracting Party shall at all times ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof as well as the acquisition of goods and services and the sale of their production, through unreasonable or discriminatory measures.</p>
        <p>(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph (1) of this Article, a Contracting Party which has concluded or may conclude an agreement regarding the formation of a customs union, a common market or a free-trade area shall be free to grant more favourable treatment to investments by investors of the State or States which are also parties to the aforesaid agreements, or by investors of some of these States.</p>
        <p>(4) The provisions of Paragraph (1) of this Article shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to investors of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from any international agreement or arrangement relating wholly or mainly to taxation or any domestic legislation relating wholly or mainly to taxation.</p>
        <p>(5) If a Contracting Party accords special advantages to development finance institutions with foreign participation and established for the exclusive purpose of development assistance through mainly non-profit activities, that Contracting Party shall not be obliged to accord such advantages to development finance institutions or other investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>

      <div type="article" num="4" title="Expropriation and Compensation">

        <p>(3) Investors of either Contracting Party who suffer losses of their investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party due to war or other armed conflict, a state of national emergency, revolt, insurrection or riot shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party, with respect to restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement, treatment which is no less favourable than that accorded to its own investors or to investors of any third State. Resulting payments shall be transferable without delay in a freely convertible currency.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Transfers">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall allow without delay the transfer in a freely convertible currency of payments in connection with an investment, such as -</p>
        <p>(a) The returns;</p>

        <p>(d) The unspent earnings of individuals, not being its nationals, who are allowed to work in connection with an investment in its territory and other amounts appropriated for the coverage of expenses connected with the management of the investment.</p>
        <p>(2) Any transfer referred to in this Agreement shall be effected at the market rate of exchange existing on the day of transfer with respect to spot transactions in the currency to be transferred. In the absence of a market for foreign exchange, the rate to be used will be the most recent rate applied to inward investments or the most recent exchange rate for conversion of currencies into Special Drawing Rights, whichever is the more favourable to the investor.</p>
        <p>(3) Transfers shall be done in accordance with the legislation pertaining thereto. Such legislation shall not, regarding either the requirements or the application thereof, impair or derogate from the undelayed transfer allowed in terms of this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If a Contracting Party or its designated agency makes a payment to any of its investors under a guarantee it has granted in respect of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall, without prejudice to the rights of the former Contracting Party under Article 8, recognise the transfer of any right or title of such an investor to the former Contracting Party or its designated agency and the subrogation of the former Contracting Party or its designated agency to any such right or title.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Disputes between an Investor and a Contracting Party">
        <p>(1) Any dispute concerning an investment between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party shall, if possible, be settled amicably.</p>
        <p>(2) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Washington Convention of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States any such dispute which has not been settled within six months, following the date on which the dispute has been raised by either party. If the parties to such a dispute have different opinions as to whether conciliation or arbitration is the more appropriate method of settlement, the investor shall have the right to choose.</p>
        <p>(3) If ICSID should not be available each Contracting Party hereby consents that the dispute, at the choice of the investor, shall be submitted for settlement by binding arbitration either to the Additional Facility of ICSID or to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal to be set up under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade law (UNCITRAL).</p>
        <p>(4) Any arbitration under paragraph (3) shall be held in a state that is a party to the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York, June 10, 1958.</p>
        <p>(5) The consent given by each Contracting Party in paragraph (2) and (3) and the submission of the dispute by an investor under the said paragraphs shall satisfy the requirement of -</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Disputes between the Contracting Parties">

        <p>(2) If the dispute cannot thus be settled within six months, following the date on which such negotiations were requested by either Contracting Party, it shall at the request of either Contracting Party be submitted to an arbitration tribunal.</p>
        <p>(3) The arbitration tribunal shall be set up from case to case, each Contracting Party appointing one member. These two members shall then agree upon a national of a third State as their chairman, to be appointed by the Governments of the two Contracting Parties.

Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of the member appointed by that Contracting Party as well as the costs for its representation in the arbitration proceedings; the cost of the chairman as well as any other costs shall be borne in equal parts by the two Contracting Parties. The arbitration tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the Contracting Parties. In all other respects, the procedure of the arbitration tribunal shall be determined by the tribunal itself.</p>
