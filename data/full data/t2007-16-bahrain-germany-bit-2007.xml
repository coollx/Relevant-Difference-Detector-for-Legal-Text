      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3">
        <p>(1) Neither Contracting State shall subject investments in its territory owned or controlled by nationals or companies of the other Contracting State to treatment less favourable than it accords to investments of its own nationals or companies or to investments of nationals or companies of any third State.</p>
        <p>(2) Neither Contracting State shall subject nationals or companies of the other Contracting State, as regards their activity in connection with investments in its territory, to treatment less favourable than it accords to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third State.</p>

The latter Contracting State shall also recognize the subrogation of the former Contracting State to any such right or claim (assigned claims) which that Contracting State shall be entitled to assert to the same extent as its predecessor in title.

        <p>(1) If the legislation of either Contracting State or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting States in addition to this Treaty contain a regulation, whether general or specific, entitling investments by nationals or companies of the other Contracting State to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by this Treaty, such regulation shall to the extent that it is more favourable prevail over this Treaty.</p>

        <p>(1) Disputes between the Contracting States concerning the interpretation or application of this Treaty should as far as possible be settled by the governments of the two Contracting States.</p>
        <p>(2) If a dispute cannot thus be settled, it shall upon the request of either Contracting State be submitted to an arbitration tribunal.</p>
        <p>(3) Such arbitration tribunal shall be constituted ad hoc as follows: each Contracting State shall appoint one member, and these two members shall agree upon a national of a third State as their chairman to be appointed by the governments of the two Contracting States. Such members shall be appointed within two months, and such chairman within three months from the date on which either Contracting State has informed the other Contracting State that it intends to submit the dispute to an arbitration tribunal.</p>
        <p>(4) If the periods specified in paragraph 3 above have not been observed, either Contracting State may, in the absence of any other arrangement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments.

If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting State or if he, too, is prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the Court next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting State should make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>(5) The arbitration tribunal shall reach its decisions by a majority of votes. Such decisions shall be binding. Each Contracting State shall bear the cost of its own member and of its representatives in the arbitration proceedings; the cost of the chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting States. The arbitration tribunal may make a different regulation concerning costs. In all other respects, the arbitration tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>

This shall not affect the possibility of appealing to such arbitration tribunal in the event that a decision of the Arbitration Tribunal established under the said Convention is not complied with (Article 27) or in the case of an assignment under a law or pursuant to a legal transaction as provided for in Article 6 of this Treaty.</p>

      <div type="article" num="11">
        <p>(1) Disputes concerning investments between a Contracting State and a national or company of the other Contracting State should as far as possible be settled amicably between the parties in dispute.</p>

      <p>The Federal Republic of Germany and the Kingdom of Bahrain have agreed on the following provisions to the Treaty of 5th February 2007 concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments:</p>
      <p>(1) Ad Article 1 (a) Returns from the investment and, in the event of their reinvestment, the returns therefrom shall enjoy the same protection as the investment.</p>
      <p>(b) Without prejudice to any other method of determining nationality, in particular any person in possession of a national passport issued by the competent authorities of the Contracting State concerned shall be deemed to be a national of that State.</p>
      <p>(2) Ad Article 2 (a) Investments made, in accordance with the legislation of either Contracting State, within the territory of that Contracting State by nationals or companies of the other Contracting State shall enjoy the full protection of the Treaty.</p>
      <p>(b) The Treaty shall also apply to the areas of the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf insofar as international law permits the Contracting State concerned to exercise sovereign rights or jurisdiction in these areas.</p>
      <p>(3) Ad Article 3 .(a) The following shall more particularly, though not exclusively, be deemed "activity" within the meaning of Article 3 (2): the management, maintenance, use and enjoyment of an investment. The following shall, in particular, be deemed "treatment less favourable" within the meaning of Article 3: unequal treatment in the case of restrictions on the purchase of raw or auxiliary materials, of energy or fuel or of means of production or operation of any kind, unequal treatment in the case of impeding the marketing of products inside or outside the country, as well as any other measures having similar effects. Measures that have to be taken for reasons of public security and order, public health or morality shall not be deemed "treatment less favourable" within the meaning of Article 3.</p>
      <p>(b) The provisions of Article 3 do not oblige a Contracting State to extend to natural persons or companies resident in the territory of the other Contracting State tax privileges, tax exemptions and tax reductions which according to its tax laws are granted only to natural persons and companies resident in its territory.</p>
      <p>(c) The Contracting States shall within the framework of their national legislation give sympathetic consideration to applications for the entry and sojourn of persons of either Contracting State who wish to enter the territory of the other Contracting State in connection with an investment; the same shall apply to employed persons of either Contracting State who in connection with an investment wish to enter the territory of the other Contracting State and sojourn there to take up employment. Applications for work permits to engage key personnel shall also be given sympathetic consideration.</p>
      <p>(4) Ad Article 4</p>
      <p>A claim to compensation shall also exist when, as a result of State intervention in the enterprise in which the investment is made, its economic substance is severely impaired.</p>
      <p>(5) Ad Article 7</p>
      <p>A transfer shall be deemed to have been made "without delay" within the meaning of Article 7 (1) if effected within such period as is normally required for the completion of transfer formalities. The said period shall commence on the day on which the relevant request has been submitted and may on no account exceed two months.</p>
      <p>(6) Whenever goods or persons connected with an investment are to be transported, each Contracting State shall neither exclude nor hinder transport enterprises of the other Contracting State and shall issue permits as required to carry out such transport. This shall include the transport of (a) Goods directly intended for an investment within the meaning of the Treaty or acquired in the territory of either Contracting State or of any third State by or on behalf of an enterprise in which assets within the meaning of the Treaty are invested;</p>
      <p>(b) Persons travelling in connection with an investment.</p>
