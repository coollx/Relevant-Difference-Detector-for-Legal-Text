        <p>(a) Natural persons who, according to the laws of that Contracting Party, are considered to be its citizens;</p>
        <p>(b) Legal entities, including companies, corporations, business associations and other organizations, which are constituted or otherwise duly organized under the laws of that Contracting Party and have their seat, together with real economic activities in the territory of that same Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>(2) The term "investments" shall include every kind of assets and particularly:</p>
        <p>(a) Movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem, such as servitudes, mortgages, liens, pledges;</p>
        <p>(b) Shares, parts or any other kinds of participation in companies;</p>
        <p>(c) Claims to money or to any rights to any performance having an economic value;</p>
        <p>(d) Intellectual and industrial property rights, such as copyrights, patents, industrial designs or models, trade or service marks, trade names, know-how and goodwill, as well as other similar rights recognized by the laws of the Contracting Parties;</p>
        <p>(e) Concessions under public law, including concessions to search for, extract or exploit natural resources as well as all other rights given by law, by contract or by decision of authority in accordance with the law.</p>
        <p>Any alternation of the form in which assets are invested or reinvested shall not affect their character as investment.</p>
        <p>(3) The term "returns" means amounts yielded by an investment and in particular, though exclusively, includes profits, dividends, interests, capital gains, royalties, management and technical assistance or other fees, irrespective of the form in which the return is paid.</p>
        <p>(4) The term "territory" means territory of Republic of Poland or the territory of Romania respectively, as well as those maritime areas, including the seabed and subsoil adjacent to the outer limit of the territorial sea of either of above territories, over which the State concerned exercises, in accordance with international law, sovereign rights or jurisdiction for the purpose of exploration or exploitation of natural resources of such areas.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion and Admission of Investment">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote as far as possible investments by investors of the other Contracting Party and admit such investments in accordance with its laws and regulations.</p>
        <p>(2) When a Contracting Party shall have admitted an investment on its territory, it shall, in accordance with its laws and regulations, grant the necessary permits in connection with such an investment, including authorizations for engaging top managerial and technical personnel of their choice, regardless of nationality.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Protection and Treatment of Investment">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall protect within its territory investments made in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, sale or liquidation of such investments. In particular, each Contracting Party or its competent authorities shall issue the necessary authorizations mentioned in Article 2, paragraph (2), of this Agreement.</p>
        <p>(2) Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment within its territory of the investments of the investors of the other Contracting Party. This treatment shall not be less favourable than that granted by each Contracting Party to investments made within its territory by its own investors, or made within its territory by investors of any third state, if this latter treatment is more favourable.</p>
        <p>(3) The most favoured nation clause shall not be construed so as to oblige a Contracting Party to extend to the investors and investments of the other Contracting Party the advantages resulting from any existing or future customs or economic union or a free trade area, to which either of the Contracting Party is or becomes a member. Nor shall such treatment relate to any advantage which either Contracting Party accords to investors of a third state by virtue of a double taxation agreement or other agreement on a reciprocal basis regarding tax matters.</p>
        <p>(4) If legislation of either Contracting Party entitles investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to treatment more favourable than is provided for by this Agreement, such legislation shall to the extend that it is more favourable prevail over this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="Free Transfer">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party in whose territory investments have been made by investors of the other Contracting Party shall grant those investors the free transfer of the payments in convertible currency relating to these investments, particularly of:</p>

        <p>(c) Proceeds accruing from the total or partial sale, alienation or liquidation of an investment.</p>
        <p>(2) Notwithstanding the provision of paragraph 1 of the present Article, either Contracting Party may, in exceptional financial or economic circumstances, impose such exchange restrictions in accordance with its laws and regulations (and in conformity with Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund).</p>
        <p>(3) Unless otherwise agreed with the investor transfers shall be made at the rate of exchange applicable on the date of transfer pursuant to the exchange regulations in force of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Expropriation and Compensation">
        <p>(1) Neither of the Contracting Parties shall take, either directly or indirectly, measures of expropriation, nationalization or any other measures having the same nature or the same effect against investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, unless the measures are taken in the public interest as established by law, on a non discriminatory basis, and under due process of law, and provided that provisions be made for effective and adequate compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the expropriated investments immediately before the impending expropriation became public knowledge, shall include interest from the date of expropriation and be freely transferable in a convertible currency.</p>
        <p>(2) The investors of one Contracting Party whose investments have suffered losses due to a war or any other armed conflict, revolution, state of emergency or rebellion, which took place on the territory of the other Contracting Party shall benefit, on the part of this latter, from a treatment in accordance with Article 3, paragraph (2) of this Agreement.

However, the Agreement shall not apply to disputes that have arisen before its entry into force.</p>
        <p>(2) The present Agreement shall not apply to investments made under intergovernmental agreements within the framework of the former Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, unless such investments are transformed according to foreign investment laws of the Contracting Parties.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Principle of Subrogation">
        <p>If either Contracting Party or its designated agency makes payment to one of its investors under any financial guarantee against non-commercial risks it has granted in regard of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter shall recognize, by virtue of the principle of subrogation, the assignment of any right or title of that investor to the first Contracting Party or its designated agency. The other Contracting Party shall be entitled to set off taxes and other public charges due and payable by the investor.</p>

        <p>(3) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to the submission of an investment dispute to international conciliation or arbitration.</p>
        <p>(4) The Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute shall at no time whatsoever during procedures involving investment disputes, assert as a defence its immunity or the fact that the investor has received compensation under an insurance contract covering the whole or part of the incurred damage or loss.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Disputes between Contracting Parties">
        <p>(1) Disputes between Contracting Parties regarding the interpretation or application of the provisions of this Agreement shall be settled through diplomatic channels.</p>
