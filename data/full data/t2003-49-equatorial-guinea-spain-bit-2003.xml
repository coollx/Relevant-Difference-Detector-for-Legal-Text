Each Contracting Party shall endeavor to grant, whenever necessary, the required authorizations in connection with the activities of consultants or qualified personnel, whatever their nationality.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Protection">
        <p>1.

        <p>4. Measures adopted for reasons of public order, public safety and public health shall not be considered as "less favorable" treatment within the meaning of this Article.</p>

        <p>1.

        <p>4. The affected investor shall be entitled, in accordance with the law of the Contracting Party carrying out the expropriation, to a prompt review of his case by the judicial or other competent and independent authority of that Contracting Party to determine whether the expropriation and the valuation of his investment have been taken in accordance with the principles set forth in this Article.</p>
        <p>5. If a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of an enterprise which is incorporated in its territory in accordance with its legislation in force, and in which there is participation of investors of the other Contracting Party, the first Contracting Party shall ensure that the provisions of this Article are applied in such a manner as to guarantee to such investors prompt, adequate and effective compensation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Compensation for Losses">
        <p>1. Investors of a Contracting Party whose investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party suffer losses due to war or other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency, insurrection, riot or any other similar occurrence shall be accorded, by way of restitution, indemnity, compensation or other settlement, treatment no less favorable than that accorded by the latter Contracting Party to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is more favorable to the investor concerned. The resulting payments shall be freely transferable.</p>
        <p>2. Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article, investors of a Contracting Party who suffer losses in any of the situations referred to in that paragraph in the territory of the other Contracting Party as a result of:</p>
        <p>a) the requisition of their investments or part of their investments by the forces or authorities of the latter Contracting Party, or </p>
        <p>b) the destruction, not required by the necessity of the situation, of their investments or part of their investments by the forces or authorities of the latter Contracting Party, </p>
        <p>shall be granted, by the latter Contracting Party, prompt, adequate and effective restitution or compensation. The resulting payments shall be made without delay and shall be freely transferable.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Transfers">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall guarantee to the investors of the other Contracting Party the free transfer of all payments related to their investments, and in particular, but not exclusively, the following:</p>
        <p>a) the initial capital and additional sums necessary for the maintenance, extension and development of the investment ;</p>
        <p>b) investment income, as defined in Article 1 ;</p>

      <div type="article" num="8" title="Other Provisions">
        <p>1. If the legal provisions of one of the Contracting Parties, or obligations arising under international law outside this Agreement, present or future, between the Contracting Parties, result in a general or specific regulation under which investments of investors of the other Contracting Party are to be accorded more favorable treatment than that provided for in this Agreement, such regulation shall prevail over this Agreement, to the extent that it is more favorable.</p>
        <p>2. Conditions more favorable than those of this Agreement which have been agreed upon by one Contracting Party with investors of the other Contracting Party shall not be affected by this Agreement.</p>

Such subrogation shall make it possible for the first Contracting Party or its designated agency to be the direct beneficiary of any indemnity or compensation payments to which the original investor may be entitled.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Settlement of Disputes between the Contracting Parties">
        <p>1. Any dispute between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall, to the extent possible, be settled through diplomatic channels.</p>
        <p>2. If the dispute cannot be so settled within six months of the commencement of negotiations, it shall, at the request of either Contracting Party, be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>

        <p>2. If the dispute cannot be settled in this way within six months from the date of written notification referred to in paragraph 1, the dispute may be submitted, at the option of the investor, to:</p>

In the event that one of the Contracting Parties is not a Contracting State to the said Convention, the dispute may be settled under the Additional Facility for the Administration of Conciliation, Arbitration and Fact-Finding Proceedings by the ICSID Secretariat; or </p>
        <p>to an arbitral tribunal established under the arbitration rules of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA).</p>
        <p>3. The arbitration shall be based on the provisions of this Agreement, the national law of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment has been made, including the rules relating to conflicts of law, as well as such rules and principles of international law as may be applicable.</p>
