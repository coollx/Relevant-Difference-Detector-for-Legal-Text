        <p>(b) Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party as regards the management, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments, treatment which is fair and equitable and not less favourable than that which it accords to its own nationals and companies or to the nationals and companies of any third State.</p>
        <p>(c) All the provisions of this Agreement relative to the grant of treatment not less favourable than that accorded to the nationals or companies of any third State shall be interpreted as meaning that such treatment shall be accorded immediately and unconditionally.</p>

        <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation, additional to those specified in this Agreement, into which it may have entered with regard to investments of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.</p>

        <p>The provisions of this Agreement relating to the grant of treatment not less favourable than that accorded to the nationals or companies of either Contracting Party or of any third State shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to the nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege which may be extended by the former Contracting Party by virtue of:</p>

        <p>(d) The grant to a particular person or company of the status of a "promoted person" under the law of Thailand on the promotion of investment; or</p>
        <p>(e) Any international agreement or arrangement, or any domestic legislation, relating wholly or mainly to taxation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Expropriation and compensation for losses">
        <p>1. (a) In any case where investments of a national or company of one Contracting Party are subjected, directly or indirectly, to any measure of expropriation, the national or company concerned shall be accorded in the territory of the other Contracting Party fair and equitable treatment in relation to any such measure. No such measure shall be taken except for public purposes and against payment of compensation. Such compensation shall be adequate, effectively realisable, made without delay and freely transferable in freely convertible currencies.</p>
        <p>(b) The legality of any expropriation and the amount and method of payment of compensation shall be subject to review by due process of law.</p>
        <p>2. Where a Contracting Party expropriates asset of a company which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its territory, and in which a national or company of the other Contracting Party owns shares, it shall ensure that the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article are applied to the extent necessary to guarantee compensation as specified therein to such national or company of the other Contracting Party who is the owner of those shares.</p>
        <p>3. Where investments of a national or company of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party suffer loss owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency, revolt, insurrection or riot in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the national or company concerned shall be accorded treatment, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement, not less favourable than would be accorded in the same circumstances to a national or company of the other Contracting Party or to a national or company of any third State.</p>
        <p>4. Without prejudice to the foregoing provisions of this Article, the nationals and companies of one Contracting Party shall, in respect of any matter dealt with therein, be accorded in the territory of the other Contracting Party treatment not less favourable than that accorded to the nationals and companies of the latter Contracting Party or of any third State.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Transfers of investments and returns">
        <p>Each Contracting Party shall guarantee to the nationals and companies of the other Contracting Party the free transfer of the capital of, and the returns from, their investments, as well as the payment of compensation under Article 6 without undue delay in freely convertible currencies at the market rate of exchange prevailing on the date of the transfer.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Subrogation">
        <p>1. If either Contracting Party or an agency designated by it makes payment to a national or company under a policy of insurance covering non-commercial risks, which it has given in respect of any investment of capital or any part thereof in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall recognise:</p>
        <p>(a) The assignment, whether under law or pursuant to a legal transaction, of any right or claim from such a national or company to the former Contracting Party or its designated agency; and</p>
        <p>(b) That the former Contracting Party or its designated agency is entitled by virtue of subrogation to exercise the rights and enforce the claims of such a national or company.</p>
        <p>2. The former Contracting Party or its designated agency shall, accordingly, be entitled to assert, if it so desires, any such right or claim to the same extent as its predecessor in title.</p>
        <p>3. If the former Contracting Party acquires amounts in the lawful currency of the other Contracting Party or credits thereof by virtue of an assignment under subparagraph (a) of paragraph 1 of this Article, such amounts and credits shall be freely available to the former Contracting Party for the purpose of meeting its expenditure in the territory of the latter Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Settlement of disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1. Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall, if possible, be settled through consultation or negotiation.</p>
        <p>2. If a dispute between the Contracting Parties can not thus be settled within six months, it shall at the request of either Contracting Party, be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>3. Such an arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case as follows:</p>
        <p>(a) Each Contracting Party shall appoint one member, and these two members shall then select a national of a third State who on approval by the two Contracting Parties shall be appointed Chairman of the tribunal;</p>
        <p>(b) The said members shall be appointed within three months, and the Chairman within four months, from the date on which either Contracting Party shall have informed the other Contracting Party that it proposes to submit the dispute to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>4. If, within the periods specified in paragraph 3 of this Article, the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other relevant agreement, invite the President of the International, Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he, too, is prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5. (a) The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be binding on both Parties.</p>
        <p>(b) Subject to the power of the arbitral tribunal to give a different ruling concerning costs, the cost of its own member and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings shall be borne by each Contracting Party and the cost of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the two Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>(c) In all respects other than those specified in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph, the arbitral tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Settlement of disputes between the contracting party and the national or company of the other contracting party">
        <p>In case both Contracting Parties are Contracting States to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, done at Washington D.C. on March 18, 1965, and failing to settle the disputes amicably, or by any other form of settlement of disputes, each Contracting Party shall consent to submit any legal dispute that may arise out of investments made by a national or company of the other Contracting Party to conciliation or arbitration at the request of such a national or company in accordance with the provisions of the said Convention.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Entry into force, duration and termination">
        <p>This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of its signature and shall remain in force for an initial period of ten years. It shall thereafter continue to be in force indefinitely, subject to the right of either Contracting Party to terminate it by twelve months' prior notice in writing to the other Contracting Party, which notice may be given at any time after the expiry of the ninth year.
