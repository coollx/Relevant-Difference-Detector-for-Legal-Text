For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is defined as a dispute involving: (a)the interpretation or application of an investment agreement between a Party and a national or company of the other Party;(b)the interpretation or application of any investment authorization granted by its foreign investment authority to such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.</p>

In the event of an investment dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party with respect to an investment of such national or company in the territory of the first Party, the parties to the dispute shall initially seek to resolve it by consultation and negotiation.

If the dispute cannot be resolved through consultation and negotiation, then the dispute shall be submitted for settlement in accordance with the applicable dispute-settlement procedures upon which they have previously agreed. Such procedures may provide for recourse to international arbitration using a forum such as the Inter-American Commercial Arbitration Commission. With respect to expropriation by either Party, any dispute-settlement procedures specified in an investment agreement between such Party and such national or company shall remain binding and shall be enforceable, in accordance with, inter alia, the terms of the investment agreement, relevant provisions of the domestic laws of such Party, and Treaties and other international agreements regarding enforcement of arbitral awards to which such Party has adhered.</p>
        <p>3. (a) The national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to the Additional Facility for settlement, either by conciliation or binding arbitration, at any time after six months from the date upon which the dispute arose. Once the national or company concerned has so consented, either party to the dispute may institute proceedings before the Additional Facility, provided the dispute has not, for any reason, been submitted for resolution in accordance with any applicable dispute settlement procedures previously agreed to by the parties to the dispute, and the national or company concerned has not brought the dispute before the courts of justice, administrative tribunals or agencies of competent jurisdiction of either Party.</p>
        <p>(b) Each Party hereby consents to the submission of an investment dispute to the Additional Facility for settlement by conciliation or binding arbitration.</p>
        <p>(c) Conciliation or binding arbitration of such dispute shall be done in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations and Rules of the Additional Facility.</p>
        <p>(d) Each Party shall provide for the enforcement within its territory of Additional Facility arbitral awards.</p>
        <p>4. In any proceeding, judicial, arbitral or otherwise, concerning an investment dispute between it and a national or company of the other Party, a Party shall not assert, as a defense, counter claim, right of set off or otherwise, that the national or company concerned has received or will receive, pursuant to an insurance contract, indemnification or other compensation for all or part of its alleged damages from any third party whatsoever, whether public or private, including such other Party and its political subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities.</p>
        <p>5. For the purpose of any proceedings before the Additional Facility in accordance with this Article, any company duly incorporated, constituted or otherwise duly organized under the applicable laws and regulations of either Party or a political subdivision thereof but that, immediately before the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to the dispute, was owned or controlled by nationals or companies of the other Party, shall be treated as a national or company of such other Party.</p>
        <p>6. The provisions of this Article shall not apply to a dispute arising (a) under the export credit, guarantee or insurance programs of the Export Import Bank of the United States or (b) under other official credit, guarantee or insurance arrangements pursuant to which the Parties have agreed to other means of settling disputes.</p>

        <p>7. The Tribunal shall decide in all matters by majority vote. Any such decision shall be binding on both Parties. Each Party shall bear the expenses of its own representation in the arbitration proceedings. Expenses incurred by the Chairman, the other arbitrators, and other costs of the proceeding shall be paid for equally by the Parties. The Tribunal may, however, at its discretion, direct that a higher proportion of the costs be paid by one of the Parties. Such a decision shall be binding.</p>
        <p>8. The Parties may agree to specific arbitral procedures. In the absence of such agreement, the Model Rules on Arbitral Procedure adopted by the United Nations International Law Commission in 1958 ("Model Rules") and commended to Member States by the United Nations General Assembly in Resolution 1262 (XIII) shall govern. To the extent that procedural questions are not resolved by this Article or the Model Rules, they shall be resolved by the Tribunal.</p>
        <p>9. This Article shall not be applicable to a dispute which has been submitted to the Additional Facility pursuant to Article VII (3).
