Applications for work permits shall likewise be treated sympathetically.</p>
        <p>(4) Ad Article 4</p>
        <p>The right to compensation shall also exist in the event that any of the measures defined in Article 4 are taken in respect of the company in which the investment is located and result in severe prejudice substantially affecting that company.</p>
        <p>(5) Ad Article 5</p>
        <p>A transfer shall be deemed to have been effected "without delay" within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 5 when it has been effected within the period of time normally necessary for the completion of the transfer formalities. The time limit, which may in no case exceed two months, shall commence to run at the time of delivery of the relevant request.</p>
        <p>(6) With respect to the transportation of goods and persons in connection with investments, each Contracting Party shall not exclude or hinder the transportation companies of the other Contracting Party and, if necessary, shall grant authorizations for the performance of the transportation.</p>
