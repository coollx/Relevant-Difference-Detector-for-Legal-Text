        <p>Any alteration of the form in which assets are invested or reinvested shall not affect their character as investments, provided that such alteration is in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment has been made.</p>
        <p>2 . The term "returns" shall mean the amounts yielded by investments and in particular, though not exclusively, shall include profits, dividends, interests, royalties, capital gains or other forms of income related to the investments including technical assistance fees.</p>

        <p>1 . Each Contracting Party shall promote and encourage, as far as possible, within its territory investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall admit such investments into its territory in accordance with its laws and regulations.</p>
        <p>2 . Each Contracting Party shall accord to investments in its territory of investors of another Contracting Party fair and equitable treatment and full and constant protection and security. In no case shall a Contracting Party accord treatment less favourable than that required by international law.</p>

        <p>4 .

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="National and most favoured nation treatment">
        <p>1 .

        <p>2 .

        <p>3 . The provisions of this Article shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to the investors of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege by virtue of:</p>
        <p>a) Any existing or future free trade area, customs union or common market to which either of the Contracting Parties is or may become a Party, and</p>

Such fair market value shall at the request of the investor be expressed in a freely convertible currency on the basis of the market rate of exchange existing for that currency on the valuation date.

        <p>2 . Transfers shall be made at the market rate of exchange existing on the date of transfer with respect to spot transactions in the currency to be transferred.

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If a Contracting Party or its designated agency makes a payment to its investor under an indemnity given in respect of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall, without prejudice to the rights of the former Contracting Party under Article 8, recognize the assignment to the former Contracting Party or its designated agency of all rights and claims of the investor which that Contracting Party or its designated agency shall be entitled to exercise by virtue of subrogation to the same extent as the Party indemnified.</p>

      <div type="article" num="8" title="Disputes between the contracting parties">

        <p>3 . Such an Arbitral Tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way. Within two (2) months of the receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the Tribunal. Those two members shall then select a national of a third State who on approval by the two Contracting Parties shall be appointed Chairman of the Tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within three (3) months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>4 .
