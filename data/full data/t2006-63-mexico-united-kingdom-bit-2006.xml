        <p>SECTION TWO: SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BETWEEN THE CONTRACTING PARTIES</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="21" title="Settlement of disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1. The Contracting Parties shall endeavour to resolve any dispute between them concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement, by means of prompt and friendly consultations and negotiations.</p>
        <p>2. If a dispute is not resolved by such means within four months from the date on which a Contracting Party requested such negotiations or consultations, the dispute shall be submitted, at the request of either Contracting Party, to an arbitral tribunal established in accordance with the provisions of this Article or, by agreement of the Contracting Parties, to any other international tribunal.</p>
        <p>3. The arbitral tribunal shall be composed of three arbitrators appointed as follows:</p>
        <p>(a) Each Contracting Party shall appoint one arbitrator; and</p>
        <p>(b) The arbitrators appointed by the Contracting Parties, within the 60 days following the date on which the second arbitrator was appointed, shall select by mutual agreement a third arbitrator who on approval by the Contracting Parties shall be appointed as chairman for the tribunal. The chairman shall be a national or a permanent resident of a third country which has diplomatic relations with the Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>4. A Contracting Party may submit a dispute to an arbitral tribunal by written notice delivered through diplomatic channels to the other Contracting Party. Such notice shall contain a statement setting out the legal and factual grounds of the claim, and the name of the arbitrator appointed by the Contracting Party initiating the proceedings. Within 60 days of delivering the notice, the respondent Contracting Party shall notify the other Contracting Party of the name of the arbitrator appointed by it.</p>
        <p>5. If within the time limits provided for in paragraph 3(b) and paragraph 4 above, the required appointments have not been made or the required approvals have not been given, either Contracting Party may request the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointment. If the President is a national or permanent resident of either Contracting Party or is otherwise unable to act, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the referred appointment. If the Vice-President is a national or permanent resident of either Contracting Party or is unable to act, the Member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national or permanent resident of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the appointment.</p>
        <p>6. In case any arbitrator appointed as provided for in this Article resigns or becomes unable to act, a successor arbitrator shall be appointed in the same manner as prescribed for the appointment of the original arbitrator, and the successor shall have all the powers and duties of the original arbitrator.</p>
        <p>7. Once convened by the chairman, the arbitral tribunal shall determine the place of arbitration and the commencement of the arbitral process.</p>
        <p>8. The arbitral tribunal shall decide all questions relating to its competence and shall, subject to any agreement between the Contracting Parties, determine its own procedure.</p>
        <p>9. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its award by a majority of votes. The arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute submitted to it in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable rules and principles of international law.</p>
        <p>10. Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of its appointed arbitrator and the costs of any legal representation in the proceedings. The costs of the chairman of the arbitral tribunal and other expenses associated with the conduct of the arbitration shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. As part of its award, the arbitral tribunal may decide, however, that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>11. The arbitral tribunal shall afford to the Contracting Parties a fair hearing. Any award shall be issued in writing and shall contain the findings of fact and law. A signed award shall be delivered to each Contracting Party. The arbitral award shall be final and binding on the Contracting Parties.</p>
