      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion and protection of investments">

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Expropriation">
        <p>(1) Investments of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation in the territory of the other Contracting Party, except for a public purpose, in accordance with legal procedures and against compensation.

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Settlement of investment disputes between a contracting party and an investor of the other contracting party">
        <p>(1) Any dispute between either Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party including expropriation or nationalisation of an investment shall, as far as possible, be settled by the disputing Parties in an amicable way.</p>
        <p>(2) The legal remedies under the laves and regulations of one Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment has been made shall be available for the investor of the other Contracting Party on the basis of treatment no less favourable than that accorded to investments of its own investors or investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the investor.</p>
        <p>(3) The Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is located may require that before recourse is made to arbitration, solution should be searched through local remedies during a period net longer than six(6) months.</p>
        <p>(4) If local remedies cannot be exhausted within the above indicated period of six(6) months or if the Contracting Party does not require that the preceeding paragraphs be applied, or if the dispute can not be settled within six(6) months from the date one of the Parties raised the dispute, it shall, upon request of either the investor or the Contracting Party, be submitted to the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes(ICSID) established by the Washington Convention of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and nationals of other States,(1) provided that the Republic of Peru becomes a party to this Convention. Until that moment the dispute shall be submitted to conciliation or arbitration procedure to be mutually agreed upon on the basis of the Washington Convention.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>(1) Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation and application of this Agreement shall, if possible, be settled through diplomatic channels.</p>
        <p>(2) 1f a dispute between the Contracting Parties cannot be settled within six (6) months, it shall, upon request of either Contracting Party, be submitted to an ad hoc Arbitral Tribunal.</p>
        <p>(3) Such an Arbitral Tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way;</p>
        <p>Within two months of the receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the Tribunal. The appointed members shall then select a citizen of a third State, who on the approval of the two Contracting Parties shall be appointed Chairman of the Tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other members. (4) If within the periods specified in paragraph 3 of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of other agreements, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make such appointments. If the President is a citizen of either Contracting Party or if he otherwise is prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a citizen of either Contracting Party or if he too is prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a citizen of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>(5) The Arbitral Tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be binding on both Contracting Parties. Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of its own member of the Tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings; the costs of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. The Tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the two Contracting Parties, and this award shall be binding on both Contracting Parties. The Tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
