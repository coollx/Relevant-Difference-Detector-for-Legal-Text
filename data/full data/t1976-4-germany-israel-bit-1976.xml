      <p>(c) Without prejudice to any other method of determining nationality, in particular any person in possession of a passport issued by the competent authorities of the Contracting Party concerned shall be deemed to be a national of that Party.</p>
      <p>(2) Ad Article 3</p>

The following shall, in particular, be deemed &#x2018;treatment less favourable' within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 3: restricting the purchase of raw or auxiliary materials of energy or fuel or of means of production or operation of any kind, impeding the marketing of products inside or outside the country, as well as any other measures having similar effects, if directed in a discriminatory way against nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party. Measures that have to be taken for reasons of public security and order, public health or morality shall not be deemed &#x2018;treatment less favourable' within the meaning of Article 3.</p>
      <p>(b) With regard to paragraph 2 of Article 3, matters of taxation shall be governed by the agreements between the Contracting Parties- for the avoidance of double taxation.</p>

      <p>In respect of the State of Israel, Article 9 shall apply to a document of admission being granted by the State of Israel following an application made after the signature of the Treaty.</p>
