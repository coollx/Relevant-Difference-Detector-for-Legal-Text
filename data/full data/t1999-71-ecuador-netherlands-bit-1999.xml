        <p>Any change in the legal form in which assets or capital are invested or reinvested does not affect their character as investment pursuant to this Agreement.</p>
        <p>b) The term "investors" shall comprise with regard to either Contracting Party:</p>
        <p>i. Natural persons having the nationality of that Contracting Party;</p>

        <p>a) The measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law;</p>
        <p>b) The measures are not discriminatory or contrary to any undertaking which the Contracting Party which takes such measures may have given;</p>
        <p>c) The measures are taken against just compensation.

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If the investments of an investor of one Contracting Party are insured against non-commercial risks or otherwise give rise to payment of indemnification in respect of such investments under a system established by law, regulation or government contract, any subrogation of the insurer or re-insurer or Agency designated by one Contracting Party to the rights of the said investor pursuant to the terms of such insurance or under any other indemnity given shall be recognised by the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Application">

      <div type="article" num="11" title="Settlement of legal disputes between an investor and a contracting party">
        <p>1. Any legal dispute between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party concerning an investment in the territory of the latter Contracting Party shall, if possible, be settled amicably.</p>
        <p>2.

      </div>

Any legal dispute between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of the present Agreement, which cannot be settled within a reasonable lapse of time by means of diplomatic negotiations, shall, unless the Parties have otherwise agreed, be submitted, at the request of either Party, to an arbitral tribunal, composed of three members. Each Party shall appoint one arbitrator and the two arbitrators thus appointed shall together appoint a third arbitrator as their chairman who is not a national of either Party.</p>
        <p>2. If one of the Parties fails to appoint its arbitrator and has not proceeded to do so within two months after an invitation from the other Party to make such appointment, the latter Party may invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointment.</p>
        <p>3. If the two arbitrators are unable to reach agreement, in the two months following their appointment, on the choice of the third arbitrator, either Party may invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointment.</p>
        <p>4. If, in the cases provided for in the paragraphs 2) and 3) of this Article, the President of the International Court of Justice is prevented from discharging the said function or is a national of either Contracting Party, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is prevented from discharging the said function or is a national of either Party, the most senior member of the Court available, who is not a national of either Party, shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5. The tribunal shall decide on the basis of respect for the law. Before the tribunal decides, it may at any stage of the proceedings propose to the Parties that the dispute be settled amicably. The foregoing provisions shall not prejudice settlement of the dispute ex aequo et bono if the Parties so agree.</p>
        <p>6. Unless the Parties decide otherwise, the tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
        <p>7. The tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be final and binding on the Parties.</p>

      <div type="article" num="14" title="Entry into force and termination">
        <p>1. The present Agreement shall enter into force on the first day of the second month following the date on which the Contracting Parties have notified each other in writing that their constitutionally required procedures have been complied with, and shall remain in force for a period of ten years.</p>
        <p>2. Unless notice of termination has been given by either Contracting Party at least six months before the date of the expiry of its validity, the present Agreement shall be extended tacitly for periods of ten years, whereby each Contracting Party reserves the right to terminate the Agreement upon notice of at least six months before the date of expiry of the current period of validity.</p>
        <p>3. In respect of investments made before the date of the termination of the present Agreement, the foregoing Articles shall continue to be effective for a further period of fifteen years from that date.</p>
