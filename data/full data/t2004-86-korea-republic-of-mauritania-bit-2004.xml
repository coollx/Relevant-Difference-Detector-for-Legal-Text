      <div type="article" num="3" title="Treatment of investments">
        <p>1.

        <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investors of the other Contracting Party as regards management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments, treatment no less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to investors.</p>

      <div type="article" num="7" title="Subrogation">
        <p>1. If a Contracting Party or its designated agency makes a payment to its own investors under an indemnity given in respect of investments, the latter Contracting Party shall recognize:</p>
        <p>(a) The assignment, whether under the law or pursuant to a legal transaction in that State, of any rights or claims from investors to the former Contracting Party or its designated agency, and</p>

        <p>2. The subrogated rights or claims shall not exceed the original rights or claims of the investor.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Settlement of investment disputes between a contracting party and an investor of the other contracting party">
        <p>1. With a view to an amicable solution of disputes, which arise within the terms of this Agreement, between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting party, consultations will take place between the parties concerned.</p>
        <p>2. If these consultations do not result in a solution within six (6) months from the date of request for settlement, the investor may, at the discretion of the investor, submit the dispute either:</p>
        <p>(a) To the competent tribunal of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made; or</p>
        <p>(b) To international arbitration of the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) created by the Convention for the Settlement of Disputes in respect of Investments occurring between States and Nationals of other States, signed in Washington on March 18, 1965.</p>
        <p>3. The local remedies under the laws and regulations of one Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment has been made shall be available for investors of the other Contracting Party, on the basis of treatment no less favorable than that accorded to investments of its own investors or investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to investors.</p>

        <p>3. Such an Arbitral Tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way: Within three (3) months from the date of receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the Tribunal. These two members shall then select a national of a third State, who on approval of the two Contracting Parties shall be appointed Chairman of the Tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within three (3) months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>4. If within the periods specified in paragraph (3) of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, a request may be made by either contracting Party to the President of the International Court of Justice to make such appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the appointments. If the Vice-President is also a national of either Contracting Party or prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the appointments.</p>
        <p>5. The Arbitral Tribunal shall reach its decisions taking into account the provisions of this Agreement and the generally recognized principles of International law.</p>
        <p>6. The Arbitral Tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be binding on both Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>7. Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of its own arbitrator and its representation in the arbitral proceedings. The costs of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by both Contracting Parties. The Arbitral Tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Application of other rules">
        <p>1.

        <p>2. If the treatment to be accorded by one Contracting Party to investors of the other Contracting Party in accordance with its laws and regulations or other specific provisions or contracts is more favourable than that accorded by this Agreement, the more favourable treatment shall be accorded.</p>
        <p>3. Either Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation that it may have entered into force with regard to investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
