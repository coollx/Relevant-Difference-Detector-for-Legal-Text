    </title>
    <preamble>
      <p>THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY and THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA</p>
      <p>DESIRING to intensify economic cooperation between the two States,</p>
      <p>INTENDING to create favourable conditions for investments by nationals and companies of either State in the territory of the other State, and</p>
      <p>RECOGNIZING that a contractual protection of such investments is apt to stimulate private business initiative and to increase the prosperity of the two States</p>
      <p>HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
    </preamble>
    <body>
      <div type="article" num="1">
        <p>(1) Each contracting State, hereinafter referred to in the present Treaty as "contracting party", shall in its territory admit the investment, in accordance with its legislation, rules and regulations existing or hereafter to be enacted and promulgated, of capital by nationals or companies of the other contracting party, promote such investments as far as possible, and give sympathetic consideration to the issuance of any relevant permits required.</p>
        <p>(2) Investments owned by, or under the influence of, nationals or companies of either contracting party shall in the territory of the other contracting party not be treated less favourably by that party than it treats investments of its own nationals or companies or investments of nationals or companies of any third State.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2">
        <p>Neither contracting party shall in its territory subject nationals or companies of the other contracting party, as regards occupational or business matters in connection with investments made by them, to conditions less favourable than it imposes on its own nationals or companies or on nationals or companies of any third State. The same shall apply in respect of the management, use, or enjoyment of such investments.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3">
        <p>(1) Investments by nationals or companies of either contracting party shall enjoy full protection and security of the law in the territory of the other contracting party.</p>
        <p>(2) Investments of nationals or companies of either contracting party in the territory of the other contracting party shall not be expropriated except for the public benefit and against just compensation. Such compensation shall represent a fair value of the investment affected; it shall be actually realizable, freely transferable and shall be made without undue delay. Adequate provision shall have been made at or prior to the time of the deprivation for the determination and the giving of such compensation. The legality of any such deprivation and the amount of compensation shall be subject to review by due process of law.</p>
        <p>(3) Nationals or companies of either contracting party who owing to hostilities in the territory of the other contracting party suffer the loss of investments situate there, shall be accorded the same treatment by such other contracting party as that party accords to its own nationals or companies, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other valuable consideration. With respect to the transfer of such payments, each contracting party shall accord to the requests of nationals or companies of the other contracting party the same treatment as is accorded to comparable requests made by nationals or companies of any third State.</p>
        <p>(4) The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 above shall likewise apply to returns from investments.</p>
        <p>(5) The nationals and companies of either contracting party shall enjoy most-favoured nation treatment in the territory of the other contracting party in respect of the matters provided for in the present Article.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4">
        <p>Either contracting party shall guarantee to nationals or companies of the other contracting party the transfer of the capital, of the returns from it and, in the event of liquidation, of the proceeds from such liquidation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5">
        <p>If a claim arising out of a guarantee given for an investment is asserted against a contracting party, the latter shall, without prejudice to its rights under Article 11, be authorized on the conditions stipulated by its predecessor in title to exercise the rights having been assigned to such party by law or having been ceded to it by the predecessor in title (devolved interest). As regards the transfer of payments to be made by virtue of the devolved interest to the contracting party concerned, paragraphs 2, 4 and 5 of Article 3 as well as Article 4 shall apply mutatis mutandis.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6">
        <p>(1) To the extent that those concerned have not made other arrangements admitted by the appropriate agencies of the contracting party in whose territory the investment is situate, transfers under paragraphs 2, 3 or 4 of Article 3, under Article 4 or Article 5 shall be made without undue delay and at the rate of exchange effective for current transactions on the day the transfer is made.Article 5 shall be made without undue delay and at the rate of exchange effective for current transactions on the day the transfer is made.</p>
        <p>(2) The rate of exchange effective for current transactions shall be based on the par value agreed with the International Monetary Fund and shall lie within the margins above or below parity as are admitted under section 3 of Article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund.</p>
        <p>(3) If at the date of transfer no rate of exchange within the meaning of paragraph 2 above exists in respect of the contracting party concerned, the official rate fixed by such contracting party for its currency in relation to the US dollar or to another freely convertible currency or to gold shall be applied. If no such rate has been fixed, the appropriate agencies of the contracting party in whose territory the capital is invested shall admit a rate of exchange that is fair and equitable.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7">
        <p>If the legislation of either contracting party or international obligations existing at present or established hereafter between the contracting parties in addition to the present Treaty, result in a position entitling investments by nationals or companies of the other contracting party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by the present Treaty, such position shall not be affected by the present Treaty. Either contracting party shall observe any other obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments within its territory by nationals or companies of the other contracting party.</p>

      <p>(b) Except as herein otherwise provided, in the event of a conflict between the provisions of the present Treaty and of national legislation, the former shall prevail.

      <p>(a) The following shall in particular be deemed conditions as referred to in Article 2: restricting the purchase of raw or auxiliary materials, of power or fuel, or of means of production or operation of any kind, impeding the marketing of products inside or outside the country, as well as any other measures having similar effects.

      <p>(b) Article 2 shall not apply to entry, sojourn, and activity as an employee.</p>
      <p>(4) Ad Article 3</p>
      <p>(a) The provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 3 shall also apply to the transfer of an invetment to public ownership, to the subjection of an investment to public control, and to similar interventions by public authorities. Expropriation shall mean the taking away of any property or any property right, which in itself or in conjunction with other rights constitutes an investment, or curtaining the management, use or enjoyment of such property or property right by such measures of sovereign power and to such an extent as are tantamount to expropriation.</p>

      <p>It is expressly understood between the contracting parties that in the territory of the Republic of Liberia aliens are excluded under the constitution of the Republic of Liberia from fee simple ownership of land.

      <p>(9) Either contracting party shall refrain from any measures which, contrary to the principles of free competition, may prevent or hinder sea-going vessels of the other contracting party from participating in the transport of goods that are intended for investment within the meaning of the present Treaty. This also applies to goods acquired in the territory of either contracting party or of any third State with funds of an enterprise in which capital within the meaning of the present Treaty is invested.</p>
      <p>Either contracting party shall refrain from any measures which, contrary to the principles of free competition, may prevent or hinder aircraft of the other contracting party from participating in the transport of passengers, baggage and cargo, if performed in connection with an investment within the meaning of the present Treaty.
