        <p>A dispute between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the former in the area of the latter which has not been settled amicably, shall, after a period of six months from written notification of the claim, be submitted to such procedures for settlement as may be agreed between the parties to the dispute.

        <p>b) If within the time limits specified above any appointment has not been made, either Contracting Party may invite the President of the International Court of Justice, in a personal and individual capacity, to make the necessary appointment within thirty days.
