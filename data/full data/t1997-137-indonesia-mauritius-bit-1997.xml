      </div>
      <div type="article" num="III" title="Promotion and protection of investments">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create favourable conditions for the making of investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party, and subject to compliance with the provisions of its laws, shall admit such investments.</p>

        <p>2. The investor affected by the expropriation shall have a right, under the law of the expropriating Contracting Party to prompt review, by a court of law of that Contracting Party of the expropriation case and the evaluation of compensation for the expropriation.</p>
        <p>3. Where a Contracting Party expropriates, nationalises or takes measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation against the assets of a company which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its territory, and in which investors of the other Contracting Party own shares, it shall as far as possible ensure that the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article are applied to the extent necessary to guarantee the compensation provided for in those paragraphs to the owners of these shares.</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="VIII" title="Subrogation">
        <p>1. If a Contracting Party or its designated agency makes a payment to its own investor under a guarantee it has given in respect of an investment made in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall recognise the assignment to the former Contracting Party of all the rights and claims of the indemnified investor, and shall also recognise that the former Contracting Party or its designated agency is entitled to exercise such rights and enforced such claims by virtue of subgrogation to the same extent as the orginal investor.</p>
        <p>2. In the case of the subgrogation as defined in paragraph 1 above, the investor shall not pursue a claim unless authorised to do so by the Contracting Party or its designated Agency.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="IX" title="Settlement of disputes between an investor and a contracting party">
        <p>1. Any dispute between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party in connection with an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall be settled amicably.</p>
        <p>2. In the event that such a dispute cannot be settled within six months, either party to the dispute may, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made, submit the dispute to the competent court of that Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>3. If any dispute cannot be settled as specified in paragraph 1 of this Article within six months, it may be submitted to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply if the investor concerned has resorted to the procedures specified in paragraph 2 of this Article.</p>
        <p>4. The ad hoc arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following manner: Each party to the dispute shall appoint an arbitrator, and these two arbitrators shall appoint as Chairman a national of a third state which has diplomatic relations with both Contracting Parties. The first two arbitrators shall be appointed within two months, and the Chairman within four months, of the date on which one party concerned notifies the other party of its submission of the dispute to arbitration.</p>
        <p>5. If the tribunal has not been constituted within the period specified in paragraph 4, either party to the dispute may, in the absence of any other agreement, request the Secretary General of the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes to make the necessary appointment.</p>
        <p>6. The tribunal shall determine its own procedures with reference to the provisions of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes, done at Washington, D.C. on 18 March 1965.</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="X" title="Settlement of disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1. Any dispute between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement should, if possible, be settled amicably through diplomatic channels.</p>
        <p>2. If the dispute cannot be settled within a period of six months following the date on which such negotiations were requested by either Contracting Party, it may upon the request of either Contracting Party, be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>3. Such an arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following manner; within two months of the receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one arbitrator for the tribunal. Those two arbitrators shall then select a national of a third State who, upon approval by the two Contracting Parties, shall be appointed Chairman of the tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two arbitrators.</p>
        <p>4. If within the periods specified in paragraph 3 of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make any necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he too is prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the International Court of Justices next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party and not prevented from discharging such functions shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be binding on both Contracting Parties. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own arbitrator to the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings. The cost of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne equally by the Contracting Parties. The tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of cost shall be borne by one of the two Contracting Parties and this award shall be binding on, and executed by, both Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>6. Apart from the above, the tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="XI" title="Application of other rules">
        <p>If the provisions of the law of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established after between the Contracting Parties, in addition to this Agreement, contain rules, whether general or specific, entitling investments and returns of investors of the other Contracting Party to treatment more favourable than that provided for by the present Agreement, such rules shall, to the extent that they are more favourable, prevail over this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="XII" title="Consultation and amendment">
        <p>Either Contracting Party may request that consultations be held on any matter concerning this Agreement, including its amendment by mutual consent. The other Party shall accord sympathetic consideration to the proposal and shall afford adequate opportunity for such consultations.</p>
