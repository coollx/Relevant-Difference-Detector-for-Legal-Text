        <p>(e) Business concessions under public law, including concessions for prospection and exploitation; </p>
        <p>Any alteration of the form in which assets are invested shall not affect their classifica- tion as an investment; </p>
        <p>(2) The term "returns" shall mean the amounts yielded by an investment for a definite period as profit, dividends, interest, license or other fees; </p>
        <p>(3) The term "nationals" shall mean: With respect to the Republic of Paraguay: </p>
        <p>Natural persons who, under the National Constitution and other norms in force in that connection in its territory, are regarded as nationals of that country; </p>
        <p>With respect to the Federal Republic of Germany: </p>
        <p>Germans within the meaning of Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany; </p>
        <p>(4) The term "companies" shall mean: </p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with its legislation, permit in its territory investments of capital by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party and promote such investments as far as possible. It shall in any case accord such investments fair and equitable treatment. </p>
        <p>(2) Neither Contracting Party shall, through arbitrary or discriminatory measures, prejudice the management, maintenance, use and enjoyment in its territory of the investments of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3">
        <p>(1) Neither Contracting Party shall subject investments in its territory owned or influenced by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to treatment less favourable than it accords to investments of its own nationals or companies or to investments of nationals or companies of any third State. </p>
        <p>(2) Neither Contracting Party shall subject nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party in its territory, insofar as their investment related activities are concerned, to treatment less favourable than it accords to its own nationals and companies or to nationals and companies of any third State. </p>
        <p>(3) Such treatment shall not extend to privileges which either Contracting Party accords to nationals or companies of third States on account of their membership in or association with a customs or economic union, a common market or a free trade area. </p>
        <p>(4) The treatment granted under this article shall not refer to privileges granted by either Contracting Party to nationals or companies of third States by virtue of a double taxation agreement or other agreements regarding matters of taxation. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4">
        <p>(1) Investments by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall enjoy full protection as well as security in the territory of the other Contracting Party. </p>
        <p>(2) Investments by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be expropriated, nationalized, or subjected to any other measure the effects of which would be tantamount to expropriation or nationalization in the territory of the other Contracting Party, except for the public benefit and against compensation. Compensation shall be equivalent to the value of the investment expropriated immediately before the date of actual impending expropriation, nationalization or comparable measure was publicly announced. </p>
        <p>The compensation shall be paid without delay and shall carry the usual bank interest until the time of payment; it shall be actually realizable and freely transferable. Appropriate measures must be taken by the time of expropriation, nationalization or comparable measure, at the latest, to determine the amount of compensation and to pay it. The legality of any such expropriation, nationalization or comparable measure and the amount of compensation shall be subject to review by due process of law. </p>
        <p>(3) Nationals or companies of either Contracting Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Contracting Party owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency, or revolt, shall be accorded by such other Contracting Party treatment no less favourable than that which that Party accords to its own nationals or companies as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other valuable consideration. Such payments shall be freely transferable. </p>
        <p>(4) Nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall enjoy most-favoured-nation treatment in the territory of the other Contracting Party in respect of the matters provided for in this article. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5">
        <p>Each Contracting Party shall guarantee to the nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party the free transfer of payments connected with an investment, especially: </p>
        <p>(a) Of the capital and additional amounts to maintain or increase the investment; </p>
        <p>(b) Of the retums; </p>
        <p>(c) In repayment of loans; </p>
        <p>(d) Of the proceeds from the sale of the whole or any part of the investment; </p>
        <p>(e) Of the compensation provided for in article 4, </p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6">
        <p>If either Contracting Party makes payment to any of its nationals or companies under a guarantee it has assumed in respect of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall, without prejudice to the rights of the former Contracting Party under article 10, recognize the assignment, whether under a law or pursuant to a legal transaction, of any right or claim from such national or company to the former Contracting Party. The latter Contracting Party shall also recognize the subrogation of the former Contracting Party to any such right or claim (assigned claims) which that Contracting Party shall be entitled to assert to the same extent as its predecessor in title. As regards the transfer of payments by virtue of such assignment, article 4, paragraphs 2 and 3, as well as article 5 shall apply mutatis mutandis. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7">
        <p>(1) Transfers pursuant to article 4, paragraph 2 or 3, article 5, or article 6 shall be made without delay at the rate in effect in each case. </p>
        <p>(2) Such a rate shall coincide with the cross rate resulting from the exchange rates which the International Monetary Fund would apply if, at the time of payment, the currencies of the countries concerned were converted into special drawing rights. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8">
        <p>(1) If the legislation of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to this Treaty contain a regulation, whether general or specific, entitling investments by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by this Treaty, such regulation shall, to the extent that it is more favourable, prevail over this Treaty. </p>
        <p>(2) Each Contracting Party shall observe any other obligations it may have entered into with regard to investments in its territory by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9">
        <p>This Treaty shall also apply to investments made prior to its entry into force by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party consistent with the latter's legislation. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10">
        <p>(1) Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Treaty should as far as possible be settled by the Governments of the two Contracting Parties. </p>
        <p>(2) If a dispute cannot thus be settled, it shall upon the request of either Contracting Party be submitted to an arbitral tribunal. </p>
        <p>(3) Such arbitral tribunal shall be constituted ad hoc as follows: each Contracting Party shall appoint one member and these two members shall agree upon a national of a third State as their chairman to be appointed by the Governments of the two Contracting Parties. Such members shall be appointed within two months, and such chairman within three months from the date on which either Contracting Party has informed the other Contracting Party that it intends to submit the dispute to an arbitral tribunal. </p>
        <p>(4) If the periods specified in paragraph 3 above have not been observed, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other relevant arrangement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party, or if he, too, is prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the Court next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party shall make the necessary appointments. </p>
        <p>(5) The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decisions by a majority of votes. Such decisions shall be binding. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own member and representatives in the arbitral proceedings; the cost of the chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. The arbitral tribunal may make a different regulation concerning costs. In all other respects, the arbitral tribunal shall determine its own procedure. </p>
        <p>(6) As both Contracting Parties are also parties to the Convention on the settlement of investment disputes between States and nationals of other States, signed at Washington, D.C, on 18 March 1965, the arbitral tribunal provided for above may, in consideration of the provisions of article 27, paragraph 1, of the said Convention, not be appealed to where agreement has been reached between the national or company of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party under article 25 of the Convention. This shall not affect the possibility of appealing to such arbitral tribunal in the event that a decision of the arbitral tribunal established under the said Convention (article 27) is not complied with or in the case of an assignment under a law or pursuant to a legal transaction as provided for in article 6 of this Treaty. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11">
        <p>(1) Disputes between either Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party in connection with investments should as far as possible be settled amicably between the Parties to the dispute. </p>
        <p>(2) If a dispute cannot be settled within six months from the date on which it has been raised by either Party to the dispute, the national or company may submit the dispute either to the national jurisdiction of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made or, alternatively, at any time, to international arbitration. In the latter case, the judicial action initiated in the courts shall be discontinued. Provided there is a desire to settle the dispute before an arbitral tribunal and provided the parties in litigation do not agree on a different arrangement, the dispute shall be submitted to an arbitral procedure in accordance with the Convention of 18 March 1965 on the settlement of investment disputes between States and nationals of other States, </p>
        <p>(3) The arbitral award shall be binding and may not be the subject of further recourse or of legal action other than as provided for in the said Convention. The award shall be executed in accordance with domestic law. </p>
        <p>(4) The Contracting Party involved in the litigation shall not plead, during an arbitral procedure or at the time of execution of an arbitral award, the fact that a national or company of the other Contracting Party has received compensation as a result of insurance against part or all of the damage. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="12">
        <p>This Treaty shall be effective irrespective of whether or not diplomatic or consular relations exist between the Contracting Parties. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="13">
        <p>(1) This Treaty shall be ratified; the instruments of ratification shall be exchanged as soon as possible at Bonn. </p>
        <p>(2) This Treaty shall enter into force one month from the date of the exchange of the instruments of ratification. It shall remain in force for a period of 10 years and shall be extended thereafter for an unlimited period unless denounced in writing by either Contracting Party 12 months before its expiration. After 10 years, the Treaty may be denounced at any time, with 12 months' prior notice. </p>
        <p>(3) In respect of investments made prior to the date of termination of this Treaty, articles 1 to 12 shall continue to be effective for a further period of 20 years from the date of termination of this Treaty.</p>
