      <p>And the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,</p>
      <p>(hereinafter referred to as "the Contracting Parties")</p>
      <p>Desiring to strengthen the traditional ties of friendship between their two countries, to extend and intensify the economic relations between them particularly with respect to investments by the nationals of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party,</p>
      <p>Recognizing that agreement upon the treatment to be accorded to such investments will stimulate the flow of capital and technology and the economic development of the Contracting Parties and that fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable,</p>
      <p>Have agreed as follows:</p>
    </preamble>
    <body>
      <div type="article" num="1" title="Definitions">
        <p>For the purposes of this Agreement:</p>
        <p>(a) The term "investments" shall comprise every kind of asset and more particularly, though not exclusively:</p>
        <p>i. Movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem in respect of every kind of asset;</p>
        <p>ii. Rights derived from shares, bonds and other kinds of interests in companies and joint ventures;</p>
        <p>iii. Title to money, other assets or any performance having an economic value;</p>
        <p>iv. Rights in the field of intellectual property (such as patents, copyrights, licences, trade marks and trade names), technical processes, goodwill and know-how;</p>
        <p>v. Rights granted under public law, including rights to prospect, explore and extract natural resources.</p>
        <p>(b) The term "nationals" shall comprise with regard to either Contracting Party:</p>
        <p>i. Natural persons having the nationality of that Contracting Party;</p>
        <p>ii. Legal persons constituted under the law of that Contracting Party;</p>
        <p>iii. Legal persons not constituted under the law of that Contracting Party but controlled, directly or indirectly, by natural persons as defined in (i) or by legal persons as defined in (ii) above.</p>
        <p>(c) Term "territory" includes the maritime areas adjacent to the coast of the State concerned, to the extent to which that State exercises sovereign rights or jurisdiction in those areas according to international law.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion">
        <p>Either Contracting Party shall, within the framework of its laws and regulations, promote economic cooperation through the protection in its territory of investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party. Subject to its right to exercise powers conferred by its laws or regulations, each Contracting Party shall admit such investments.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Protection">
        <p>1) Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by those nationals.</p>
        <p>2) More particularly, each Contracting Party shall accord to such investments full physical security and protection which in any case shall not be less than that accorded either to investments of its own nationals or to investments of nationals of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the national concerned.</p>
        <p>3) If a Contracting Party has accorded special advantages to nationals of any third State by virtue of agreements establishing customs unions, economic unions, monetary unions or similar institutions, or on the basis of interim agreements leading to such unions or institutions, that Contracting Party shall not be obliged to accord such advantages to nationals of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>4) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement, each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>5) If the provisions of law of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to this Agreement contain a regulation, whether general or specific, entitling investments by nationals of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by this Agreement, such regulation shall to the extent that it is more favourable prevail over this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="Taxation">
        <p>With respect to taxes, fees, charges and fiscal deductions and exemptions, each Contracting Party shall accord to nationals of the other Contracting Party who have investments in its territory, treatment not less favourable than that accorded to its own nationals or to those of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the nationals concerned. For this purpose, however, there shall not be taken into account any special fiscal advantages accorded by that Party:</p>
        <p>Under an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation; or</p>
        <p>By virtue of its participation in a customs union, economic union or similar institution; or</p>

        <p>(b) Funds necessary</p>
        <p>i. For the acquisition of raw or auxiliary materials, semi-fabricated or finished products; or</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If the investments of a national of one Contracting Party are insured against non-commercial risks under a system established by law, any subrogation of the insurer or re-insurer to the rights of the said national pursuant to the terms of such insurance shall be recognized by the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Settlement of disputes between one contracting party and a national of the other contracting party">
        <p>Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit any legal dispute arising between that Contracting Party and a national of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of that national in the territory of the former Contracting Party to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at Washington on 18 March, 1965. A legal person which is a national of one Contracting Party and which before such a dispute arises is controlled by nationals of the other Contracting Party shall in accordance with Article 25(2) (b) of the Convention for the purpose of the Convention be treated as a national of the other Contracting Party.</p>

        <p>5) The tribunal shall decide on the basis of this Agreement and other relevant agreements between the two Contracting Parties, rules of International Law and relevant rules of Domestic Law.
