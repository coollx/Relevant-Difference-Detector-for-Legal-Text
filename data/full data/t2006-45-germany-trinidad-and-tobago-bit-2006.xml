      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion of investments">
        <p>Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create favourable conditions for investments in its territory by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party and shall admit such investments in accordance with the laws in force in its territory.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Protection of investments">
        <p>(1) Investments of nationals or companies of each Contracting Party shall be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="National treatment and most-favoured-nation treatment">
        <p>(1) Neither Contracting Party shall subject investments in its territory owned or controlled by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to treatment less favourable than it accords to investments of its own nationals or companies or to investments of nationals or companies of any third State.</p>
        <p>(2) Neither Contracting Party shall subject nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party as regards their activity in connection with investments such as management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments in its territory to treatment less favourable than it accords to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third State.</p>
        <p>(3) Such treatment shall not relate to privileges which either Contracting Party accords to nationals or companies of third States on account of its membership of, or association with, a customs or economic union, a common market or a free trade area.</p>

        <p>(6) Issues of taxation on income and on capital shall be dealt with in accordance with the agreement for the avoidance of double taxation between the Contracting Parties and in accordance with the respective national tax law.

      <div type="article" num="5" title="Expropriation">
        <p>(1) Investments by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be directly or indirectly expropriated, nationalized or subjected to any other measure the effects of which would be tantamount to expropriation or nationalization (hereinafter referred to as "expropriation") in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose and against compensation. Such compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the date of the actual expropriation or the date on which the threatened expropriation has become publicly known, whichever is the earlier. The compensation shall be paid without delay and shall carry the usual bank rate of interest until the time of payment and shall be effectively realizable and freely transferable. Provision shall have been made in an appropriate manner at or prior to the time of expropriation for the determination and payment of such compensation. The legality of any such expropriation and the amount of compensation shall be subject to review by due process of law.</p>

        <p>Nationals or companies of either Contracting Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Contracting Party owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency or revolt, shall be accorded treatment no less favourable by such other Contracting Party than that which the latter Contracting Party accords to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third State as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other valuable consideration. Such payments shall be freely transferable.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Repatriation of investments and returns">
        <p>Each Contracting Party shall guarantee to nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party the free transfer of payments in connection with an investment, in particular:</p>
        <p>(a) Of the principal and additional amounts to maintain or increase the investment;</p>
        <p>(b) Of the returns;</p>
        <p>(c) In repayment of loans as defined in Article 1 (1) (a) (iii);</p>
        <p>(d) Of the proceeds from the liquidation or the sale of the whole or any part of the investment;</p>
        <p>(e) Of the compensation provided for in Articles 5 and 6.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Subrogation">
        <p>(1) If either Contracting Party makes a payment to any of its nationals or companies under a guarantee it has assumed in respect of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall, without prejudice to the rights of the former Contracting Party under Article 12, recognize the assignment whether under a law or pursuant to a legal transaction, of any right or claim of such national or company to the former Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>(2) The latter Contracting Party shall also recognize the subrogation of the former Contracting Party to any such right or claim (assigned claims) which that Contracting Party shall be entitled to assert to the same extent as its predecessor in title. As regards the transfer of payments made by virtue of such assigned claims, Article 5 (1) and Article 6 as well as Article 7 shall apply mutatis mutandis.</p>

        <p>(2) Notwithstanding Article 7, a Contracting Party</p>
        <p>(a) May require reports of transfers of currency or other monetary instruments provided that such requirements shall not unreasonably impair or derogate from the free and undelayed transfer ensured by this Treaty; and</p>
        <p>(b) Shall ensure the satisfaction of judgements in civil, administrative and criminal proceedings through the equitable, nondiscriminatory and good faith application of its laws and regulations.</p>
        <p>(3) Should there be no foreign exchange market, the cross rate obtained from those rates which would be applied by the International Monetary Fund on the date of payment for conversions of the currencies concerned into Special Drawing Rights, shall apply.</p>
        <p>(4) A transfer shall be deemed to have been made "without delay" within the meaning of paragraph (1) of this Article if effected within such period as is normally required for the completion of transfer formalities. The said period will commence on the day on which the relevant request has been submitted and may not exceed three months. In respect of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, the transfer of the proceeds from the liquidation or the sale of the investment may not exceed four months.</p>

        <p>If the law in force in the territory of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to this Treaty contains regulations, whether general or specific, entitling investments by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by this Treaty, such regulations shall to the extent that they are more favourable prevail over this Treaty.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Application of the treaty">
        <p>This Treaty shall also apply to investments made prior to its entry into force by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party consistent with the law in force in the territory of the latter, but the provisions of this Treaty shall not apply to any dispute or claim which has been raised before its entry into force.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="12" title="Settlement of disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>(1) Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Treaty should, as far as possible, be settled through diplomatic channels.</p>
        <p>(2) If a dispute cannot thus be settled, it shall, upon the request of either Contracting Party, be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>

        <p>(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Treaty in relation to an investment of the latter should as far as possible be settled amicably between the parties in dispute.</p>
        <p>(2)</p>
        <p>(a) If the dispute cannot thus be settled within six months following the date on which the dispute has been raised by either party, it shall be submitted, upon request of a national or company, either to the competent tribunal of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made, or to international arbitration according to the provisions of paragraph (3) of this Article.</p>
        <p>(b) A national or company of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago holding an investment in Germany can seek international arbitration even after the dispute has been decided by a German court. A national or company of the Federal Republic of Germany holding an investment in Trinidad and Tobago may not seek international arbitration if a court of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago has rendered a decision in substance on the dispute.</p>
        <p>(3) In case of international arbitration, the dispute shall be submitted, at the choice of a national or company either to:</p>
        <p>(a) The International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) created by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature in Washington on 18 March 1965; or</p>
        <p>(b) The Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce; or</p>
        <p>(c) An arbitral tribunal established in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).</p>
        <p>(4) The award shall be binding on both parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or remedy other than those provided for in the said instruments. The award shall be enforced in accordance with domestic law.</p>
