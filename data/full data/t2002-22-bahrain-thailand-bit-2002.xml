        <p>4. Without prejudice to the foregoing provisions of this Article, the investors of one Contracting Party shall, in respect of any matter dealt with therein, be accorded in the territory of the other Contracting Party treatment not less favourable than accorded to the investors of the latter Contracting Party or of any third State.</p>

        <p>Each Contracting Party shall guarantee to the investors of the other Contracting Party the free transfer of the capital of, and the returns from, their investments, as well as the payment of compensation under Articles 6, 9, and 10 without undue delay in freely usable currencies at the market rate of exchange prevailing on the date of transfer.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Subrogation">
        <p>1. If either Contracting Party or an agency designated by it makes payment to an investor under a policy of insurance covering noncommercial risks, which it has given in respect of any investment or any part there of in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall recognise:</p>
        <p>(a) The assignment, whether under law or pursuant to a legal transaction, of any right or claim from such an investor to the former Contracting Party or its designated agency; and</p>
        <p>(b) That the former Contracting Party or its designated agency is entitled by virtue of subrogation to exercise the rights and enforce the claims of such an investor.</p>
        <p>2. The former Contracting Party or its designated agency shall, accordingly, be entitled to assert, if it so desires, any such right or claim to the same extent as its predecessor in title.</p>
