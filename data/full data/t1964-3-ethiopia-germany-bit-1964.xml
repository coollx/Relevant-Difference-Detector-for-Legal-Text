    </title>
    <preamble>
      <p>THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY and the EMPIRE OF ETHIOPIA</p>
      <p>Desiring to intensify economic cooperation between both States,</p>
      <p>Intending to create favourable conditions for investments by nationals and companies of either State in the territory of the other State, and</p>
      <p>Recognizing that contractual protection of all assets of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party is apt to promote private investments and private business initiatives and to increase the prosperity of both nations,</p>
      <p>Have agreed as follows:</p>
    </preamble>
    <body>
      <div type="article" num="1">
        <p>Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote as far as possible the investments by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party and admit such investments in accordance with its legislation. Such investments shall enjoy the full protection of the present Treaty if made in accordance with such legislation. Each Contracting Party shall in any case accord such investments fair and equitable treatment.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2">
        <p>Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject investments owned or controlled by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party or any activities in connexion with such investments to treatment less favourable than it accords to investments of its own nationals or companies or to investments of nationals or companies of any third State.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3">
        <p>(1) Investments by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall enjoy full protection as well as security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>(2) Investments by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be expropriated in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for the public benefit and against compensation. Such compensation shall represent the equivalent of the investment expropriated; it shall be actually realizable, freely transferable and shall be made without delay. Provision shall have been made in an appropriate manner at or prior to the time of expropriation for the determination and the giving of such compensation. The legality of any such expropriation and the amount of compensation shall be subject to review by due process of law.</p>
        <p>(3) Nationals or companies of either Contracting Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Contracting Party owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency, or revolt, shall be accorded treatment no less favourable by such other Contracting Party than that Party accords to its own nationals or companies, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other valuable consideration.</p>
        <p>(4) Nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall enjoy most-favoured-nation treatment in the territory of the other Contracting Party in respect of the matters provided for in the present Article.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4">
        <p>Either Contracting Party shall in respect of investments guarantee to nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party the free transfer of the capital, of the returns from it and, in the event of liquidation, of the proceeds from such liquidation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5">
        <p>If either Contracting Party makes payment to any of its nationals or companies under a guarantee it has assumed in respect of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall, without prejudice to the rights of the former Contracting Party under Article 10, recognize the assignment, whether under a law or pursuant to a legal transaction, of any right or claim from such national or company to the former Contracting Party as well as the subrogation of that Contracting Party to any such right or claim which that Contracting Party shall be entitled to assert to the same extent as its predecessor in title. As regards the transfer of payments to be made to the Contracting Party concerned by virtue of such assignment, paragraph 2 of Article 3 as well as Article 4 shall apply mutatis mutandis.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6">
        <p>(1) To the extent that those concerned have not made another. arrangement admitted by the appropriate agencies of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is situate, transfers under paragraph 2 of Article 3, under Article 4 or Article 5 shall be made without delay and at the rate of exchange for current transactions based on the par value agreed with the International Monetary Fund and within the margins above or below parity admitted under section 3 of Article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund and as effected on the day the transfer is made.</p>
        <p>(2) If at the date of transfer no rate of exchange within the meaning of paragraph 1 above exists in respect of either Contracting Party, the official rate fixed by such Contracting Party for its currency in relation to the US Dollar or to another freely convertible currency or to gold shall be applied. If no such rate has been fixed, the appropriate agencies of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is situate shall admit a rate of exchange that is fair and equitable.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7">
        <p>(1) If the legislation of either Contracting Party or international obligations existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Treaty, contain a regulation, whether general or specific, entitling investments by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favour- able than is provided for by the present Treaty, such regulation shall to the extent that it is more favourable prevail over the present Treaty.</p>
        <p>(2) Either Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation it may enter into with nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party regarding investments in its territory by such nationals or companies.</p>
      </div>

The following shall, in particular, be deemed "treatment less favourable" within the meaning of Article 2: restricting the purchase of raw or auxiliary materials, of power or fuel or of means of production or operation of any kind, impeding the marketing of products inside or outside the country, as well as any other measures having similar effects.

        <p>b) Article 2 shall not apply to entry, sojourn and activity as an employee.</p>
        <p>(2) Ad Article 3</p>
        <p>a) Expropriation shall mean the taking in whole or in part of any investment as well as the restricting of any investment the effect of which is tantamount to such taking.</p>
        <p>b) The provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 3 shall also apply to the transfer of an investment to public ownership as well as to the subjection of an investment to public control or to similar interventions by public authorities the effect of which is tantamount to expropriation as defined in paragraph a) above.</p>
        <p>(3) Ad Article 4</p>

        <p>Either Contracting Party reserves the right to apply Articles 4 and 5 to a certain investment only after its prior express approval.</p>
        <p>(5) Ad Article 6</p>
        <p>A transfer shall be deemed to have been made "without delay" within the meaning of paragraph 1 of Article 6 if made within such period as is normally required for the completion of transfer formalities.

        <p>(6) Ad Article 8</p>
        <p>a) Assets within the meaning of paragraph 1 of Article 8 shall comprise all categories of assets including all categories of rights and interests whether used in economically productive activities or not and shall include but not be limited to:</p>

        <p>(ee) business concessions under public law, including concessions to search for, extract or exploit natural resources.</p>
        <p>Any alteration of the form in which assets are in- vested shall not affect their classification as investment.</p>
        <p>b) Returns from an investment, as well as returns: from re-invested returns, shall enjoy the same protection as the original investment.</p>
        <p>c) Without prejudice to any other method of determining nationality, any person in possession of a national passport issued by the appropriate authorities of either Contracting Party shall be deemed to be a national of that Party.</p>
        <p>(7) Either Contracting Party shall refrain from any measures which, contrary to the principles of free competition, may prevent or hinder sea-going vessels or aircrafts of the other Contracting Party from participating in the transport of goods intended for, or of persons travelling in connexion with, an investment within the meaning of the present Treaty. This also applies to goods acquired in the territory of either Contracting Party or of any third State with funds of an enterprise in which capital within the meaning of the present Treaty is invested; it applies furthermore to persons travelling on behalf of such an enterprise.</p>
