        <p>2.

        <p>3. Within two (2) months of receipt of a request, each Contracting Party shall appoint an&nbsp;arbitrator. The two arbitrators shall select a third arbitrator as Chairman, who is a national&nbsp;of a third State.

Unless otherwise agreed, all submissions shall be made and all hearings shall be&nbsp;completed within eight (8) months of the date of selection of the Chairman, and the&nbsp;tribunal shall render its decision within two (2) months after the date of the final&nbsp;submissions or the date of the closing of the hearings, whichever is later. The arbitral&nbsp;tribunal shall reach its decisions, which shall be final and binding, by a majority of votes. Arbitral Tribunal shall reach its decision on the basis of this Agreement and in accordance with international law applicable between the Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>8. Expenses incurred by the Chairman, the other arbitrators, and other costs of the&nbsp;proceedings shall be paid for equally by the Contracting Parties. The tribunal may,&nbsp;however, at its discretion, decide that a higher proportion of the costs be paid by one of the&nbsp;Contracting Parties,</p>
        <p>9. A dispute shall not be submitted to an international arbitral tribunal under the provisions&nbsp;of this Article, if a dispute on the same matter has been brought before another&nbsp;international arbitral tribunal under the provisions of Article 10 and is still before the&nbsp;tribunal. This will not impair the engagement in direct and meaningful negotiations&nbsp;between both Contracting Parties.</p>
