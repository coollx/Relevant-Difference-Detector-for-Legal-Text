      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Protection of Investments">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall, at all times, extend in its territory full protection and security to investments and returns of investors of the other Contracting Party.

        <p>2. Investments or returns of investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall be accorded fair and equitable treatment in accordance with international law and the provisions of this Agreement.</p>

      <div type="article" num="4" title="National and Most Favoured Nation Treatment">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall accord in its territory to investments and returns of investors of the other Contracting Party a treatment no less favourable than that which it accords to investments and returns of its own investors, or investments and returns of investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the investors concerned.</p>
        <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall accord in its territory to the investors of the other Contracting Party, as regards management, maintenance, enjoyment, use or disposal of their investment, a treatment no less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the investors concerned.</p>
        <p>3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to the investors of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege which may be extended by the former Contracting Party by virtue of:</p>
        <p>a) Any existing or future customs union or economic union, free trade area or similar international agreements to which either of the Contracting Party is or may become a party in the future;</p>

        <p>b) On a non-discriminatory basis,</p>
        <p>c) In accordance with due process of law, and</p>

        <p>2. Such compensation shall be paid without delay.</p>
        <p>3. Such compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation occurred. The fair market value shall not reflect any change in value occurring because the expropriation had become publicly known earlier.</p>
        <p>4. Such compensation shall be fully realisable and freely transferable in accordance with Article 7 of this Agreement.</p>
        <p>5. An investor of a Contracting Party affected by the expropriation carried out by the other Contracting Party shall have the right to prompt review of its case, including the valuation of its investment and the payment of compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Article, by a judicial authority or another competent and independent authority of the latter Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Compensation for Damage or Loss">
        <p>1. When investments made by investors of either Contracting Party suffer loss or damage due to war or other armed conflict, civil disturbances, revolution, riot or similar events in the territory of the other Contracting Party, they shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party, treatment, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or any other settlement, no less favourable than that accorded by the latter Contracting Party to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is most favourable to the investors concerned.</p>
        <p>2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1 of this Article, investors of one Contracting Party who in any of the events referred to in that paragraph suffer damage or loss in the territory of the other Contracting Party resulting from:</p>
        <p>a) Requisitioning of their property or part thereof by the latter's forces or authorities;</p>
        <p>b) Destruction of their property or part thereof by the latter's forces or authorities which was not caused in combat action or was not required by the necessity of the situation,</p>
        <p>Shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party prompt restitution, and where applicable prompt, adequate and effective compensation for damage or loss sustained during the period of requisitioning or as a result of destruction of their property. Resulting payment shall be made without delay in a freely convertible currency. 3. An investor whose investment suffers damage or loss in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article, shall have the right to prompt review of its case by a judicial or other competent authority of that Contracting Party and of the valuation of its investments and payment of compensation in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 2 of this Article.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Transfers">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall ensure that all payments relating to an investment in its territory of an investor of the other Contracting Party may be freely transferred into and out of its territory without delay. Such transfers shall include, in particular, though not exclusively:</p>
        <p>a) The initial capital and additional amounts to maintain or increase an investment;</p>

        <p>2. Any transfer referred to in this Article shall be effected at the market rate of exchange existing on the day of transfer with respect to spot transactions in the currency to be transferred. In the absence of a market for foreign exchange, the rate to be used will be the most recent rate applied to inward investments or the most recent exchange rate for conversion of currencies into Special Drawing Rights, whichever is more favourable to the investor.</p>
        <p>3. Each Contracting Party shall ensure that the interest at the commercial rate established on the market basis for the currency in question is calculated together with compensation for the period starting from the occurrence of events under Articles 5, 6 and 8 until the date of transfer of payment and payment will be effected in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If a Contracting Party or its designated agency makes a payment to its own investor under an indemnity, guarantee or contract of insurance against non-commercial risks, given in respect of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall recognise the assignment of any right or claim of such investor to the former Contracting Party or its designated agency and the right of the former Contracting Party or its designated agency to exercise by virtue of subrogation any such right and claim to the same extent as its predecessor in title.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Application of other Obligations">
        <p>If the provisions of law of either Contracting Party or international obligations existing at present or established thereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement, contain a rule, whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by the present Agreement, such rule shall, to the extent that it is more favourable, prevail over the present Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Settlement of Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of the other Contracting Party">
        <p>1. Any investment dispute between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party shall be settled amicably by negotiation.</p>
        <p>2. If a dispute under paragraph 1 of this Article cannot be settled within six (6) months from a written notification, the dispute shall, upon the request of the investor, be settled as follows:</p>
        <p>a) By a competent court of the host Contracting Party, or</p>
        <p>b) By conciliation or arbitration by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, opened for signature in Washington on March 18, 1965. In case of arbitration, each Contracting Party, by this Agreement irrevocably consents in advance, even in the absence of an individual arbitral agreement between the Contracting Party and the investor, to submit any such dispute to this Centre. This implies the renunciation of the requirement that the internal administrative or judicial remedies should be exhausted; or</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Settlement of Disputes between the Contracting Parties">
        <p>1. Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be settled as far as possible by negotiation.</p>

Such arbitral tribunal shall be constituted ad hoc as follows: each Contracting Party shall appoint one arbitrator and these two arbitrators shall agree upon a national of a third State as their chairman. Such arbitrators shall be appointed within two (2) months from the date one Contracting Party has informed the other Contracting Party, of its intention to submit the dispute to an arbitral tribunal, the chairman of which shall be appointed within two (2) further months.</p>
        <p>4. If the periods specified in paragraph 3 of this Article are not observed, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other relevant arrangement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President of the International Court of Justice is a national of either of the Contracting Parties or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President or in case of his inability the member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority should be invited under the same conditions to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5. The arbitral tribunal shall establish its own rules of procedure.</p>
        <p>6. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision in virtue of the present Agreement and pursuant to the rules of international law. It shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. The decision shall be final and binding.</p>
        <p>7. Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of its own arbitrator and of its legal representation in the arbitration proceedings. The costs of the chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by both Contracting Parties. The tribunal may, however, in its award determine another distribution of costs.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="12" title="Application of the Agreement">
        <p>This Agreement shall apply to investments made prior to or after the entry into force of this Agreement, but shall not apply to any investment dispute that may have arisen before its entry into force.</p>
