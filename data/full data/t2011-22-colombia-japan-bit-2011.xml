          <p>(b)  the disputing investor's written consent for the Secretary-General to appoint the disputing investor's arbitrator.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="28" title="Consent to arbitration">
          <p>1.  Each Contracting Party hereby consents to the submission of investment disputes by a disputing investor to arbitration set forth in paragraph 5 of Article 27 chosen by the disputing investor, except for disputes with regard to paragraph 3 of Article 4.</p>
          <p>2.  For investment disputes with regard to paragraph 3 of Article 4:</p>
          <p>(a)  necessary consent for the submission to the arbitration will be given by the competent authority of the disputing Party set out in Article 41; and</p>
          <p>(b)  in cases where the written agreement referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 4 stipulates a dispute settlement procedure, such procedure shall prevail over this Chapter.</p>
          <p>3.  The consent given by paragraph 1 and the submission by a disputing investor of an investment dispute to arbitration shall satisfy the requirements of:</p>
          <p>(a)  Chapter II of the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, for written consent of the parties to a dispute; and</p>
          <p>(b)  Article II of the New York Convention, for an agreement in writing.</p>

        <div type="article" num="29" title="Conditions and limitations to the consent and to the claims">
          <p>1.  An investor of a Contracting Party whose investments were not established, acquired or expanded in accordance with the laws and regulations of the other Contracting Party which are not inconsistent with this Agreement shall not resort to the dispute settlement under this Chapter to settle an investment dispute with respect to such investments.</p>
          <p>2.  With regard to investment disputes with respect to investments or investment activities of a disputing investor relating to financial services, this Chapter only applies to claims regarding investments already established, acquired or expanded in the Area of the disputing Party in accordance with its laws and regulations, as well as the investment activities associated with such investments.</p>
          <p>3.  With regard to investment disputes with respect to investments or investment activities of a disputing investor relating to activities or services that are part of a public retirement plan or social security system established by the laws and regulations of the disputing Party, this Chapter only applies to claims regarding investments already established, acquired or expanded in the Area of the disputing Party in accordance with its laws and regulations, as well as the investment activities associated with such investments.</p>
          <p>4.  No investment dispute may be submitted to arbitration set forth in paragraph 5 of Article 27, if more than three years have elapsed since the date on which the disputing investor acquired or should have first acquired, whichever is the earlier, the knowledge of the breach alleged under paragraph 2 of Article 27 and knowledge that the disputing investor, in the case of subparagraph 2(a) of Article 27, or the enterprise, in the case of subparagraph 2(b) of Article 27, had incurred loss or damage.</p>
          <p>5.  No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Chapter unless:</p>
          <p>(a)  the disputing investor consents in writing to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Chapter; and</p>
          <p>(b)  the notice of arbitration is accompanied:</p>
          <p>(i)  for claims submitted to arbitration</p>
          <p>Under subparagraph 2(a) of Article 27, by disputing investor's written waiver; or</p>
          <p>(ii)  for claims submitted to arbitration under subparagraph 2(b) of Article 27, by the disputing investor's and the enterprise's written waiver;</p>
          <p>Of any right to initiate before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of either Contracting Party or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to any measure of the disputing Party alleged to constitute a breach referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 27.</p>
          <p>6.  Notwithstanding subparagraph 5(b), the disputing investor, for claims submitted under subparagraph 2(a) of Article 27, and the disputing investor or the enterprise, for claims submitted under subparagraph 2(b) of Article 27, may initiate or continue an action that seeks interim injunctive relief that does not involve the payment of monetary damages before a judicial or administrative tribunal of the disputing Party.</p>
          <p>7.  The consent and waiver required by this Article shall be delivered to the disputing Party.</p>
          <p>8.  Where the disputing Party has deprived the disputing investor of the control of an enterprise, a waiver from the enterprise under subparagraph 5(b)(ii) shall not be required.</p>
          <p>9.  Once the disputing investor has submitted an investment dispute to administrative tribunal or court of the disputing Party or to any of the arbitration under paragraph 5 of Article 27, that election shall</p>
          <p>Be definitive and the disputing investor may not submit thereafter the same dispute to the other arbitrations set forth in paragraph 5 of Article 27.</p>
          <p>10.  Neither Contracting Party shall give diplomatic protection, or bring an international claim, in respect of an investment dispute which the other Contracting Party and an investor of the former Contracting Party have consented to submit or submitted to arbitration set forth in paragraph 5 of Article 27, unless that other Contracting Party has failed to abide by and comply with the award rendered in such investment dispute. Diplomatic protection, for the purposes of this paragraph, shall not include informal diplomatic exchanges for the sole purpose of facilitating a settlement of the investment dispute.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="30" title="Establishment of a tribunal">
          <p>1.  Unless the disputing parties agree otherwise, a Tribunal shall comprise three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each of the disputing parties and the third, who shall be the presiding arbitrator, appointed by agreement of the disputing parties.</p>
          <p>2.  If the disputing investor or the disputing Party fails to appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators within seventy-five (75) days from the date on which the investment dispute was submitted to arbitration under this Chapter, the Secretary-General may be requested by either of the disputing parties to appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed from the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators subject to the requirements of this Article. The Secretary-General should make such appointment in its discretion and, to</p>
          <p>The extent practicable, after having heard the disputing parties.</p>
          <p>3.  Unless the disputing parties agree otherwise, the presiding arbitrator shall not be a national of either Contracting Party, nor have his or her usual place of residence in the territory of either Contracting Party, nor be affiliated with either of the disputing parties, nor have dealt with the investment dispute in any capacity.</p>
          <p>4.  In appointing the arbitrators, the disputing parties consider that arbitrators of a Tribunal should have expertise and competence in the fields of international public law, the law on foreign investment or the subject-matters of the investment dispute arisen between the disputing parties.</p>
          <p>5.  For the purposes of paragraph 2, each of the disputing parties may indicate up to three nationalities, the appointment of arbitrators of which is unacceptable to it. In this event, the Secretary-General may be requested not to appoint as arbitrator any person whose nationality is indicated by either of the disputing parties.</p>
          <p>6.  The disputing parties may agree on the fees to be paid to the arbitrators. If the disputing parties do not reach an agreement on the fees to be paid to the arbitrators before the establishment of the Tribunal, the fees and expenses established from time to time in the ICSID and effective at the time of the establishment of the Tribunal shall apply.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="31" title="Governing law">
          <p>The Tribunal shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law.</p>
          <p>Note: In accordance with international law and where</p>
          <p>Relevant and appropriate, a Tribunal may take into consideration the law of the disputing Party. However, a Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to determine the legality of a measure, alleged to constitute a breach of this Agreement, under the domestic law of the disputing Party.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="32" title="Transparency in arbitral proceedings for the other contracting party">
          <p>The disputing Party shall provide the other Contracting Party with:</p>

        <div type="article" num="33" title="Place of arbitration">
          <p>The arbitration shall be held in a country agreed by the disputing parties. If the disputing parties fail to reach an agreement, the Tribunal shall determine the place in a country that is a party to the New York Convention.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="34" title="Preliminary questions">
          <p>Before ruling on the merits, the Tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection to jurisdiction and admissibility by the disputing Party. When deciding on any objection of the disputing Party, the Tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs including attorney's fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection.</p>
          <p>In determining whether such an award is warranted, the Tribunal shall consider whether the claim was frivolous or whether the objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="35" title="Interim measures of protection">
          <p>A Tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party or to facilitate the conduct of arbitral proceedings, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party. The Tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 27.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="36" title="Expert reports">
          <p>Without prejudice to the appointment of other kinds of experts where authorized by the applicable arbitration rules, a Tribunal, at the request of a disputing party or, unless the disputing parties disapprove, on its own initiative, may appoint one or more experts to report to it in writing on any factual issue concerning environmental, health, safety and other scientific matters raised by a disputing party in a proceeding, subject to such terms and conditions as the disputing parties may agree.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="37" title="Consolidation of multiple claims">
          <p>1.  Where two or more claims have been submitted separately to arbitration under paragraph 2 of Article 27, and the claims have a question of law or fact in common and arise out of the same events or circumstances, any disputing party may seek a consolidation order in accordance with the terms set forth in paragraphs 2 through 10.</p>
          <p>2.  A disputing party that seeks a consolidation order under this Article shall deliver, in writing, a request to the Secretary-General to establish a Tribunal under this Article, and shall specify in the request:</p>
          <p>(a)  the names and addresses of all the disputing parties sought to be covered by the order;</p>
          <p>(b)  the nature of the order sought; and</p>
          <p>(c)  the grounds on which the order is sought.</p>
          <p>3.  Unless the Secretary-General finds within sixty (60) days after receiving a request under paragraph 2 that the request is manifestly unfounded, a Tribunal shall</p>
          <p>Be established under this Article.</p>
          <p>4.  Unless all the disputing parties sought to be covered by the order otherwise agree, a Tribunal established under this Article shall comprise three arbitrators:</p>
          <p>(a)  one arbitrator appointed by agreement of the disputing investors;</p>
          <p>(b)  one arbitrator appointed by the disputing Party; and</p>
          <p>(c)  the presiding arbitrator appointed by the Secretary-General, provided, however, that the presiding arbitrator shall not be a national of either Contracting Party, nor have his or her usual place of residence in the territory of either Contracting Party, nor be affiliated with either of the disputing parties, nor have dealt with the investment dispute in any capacity.</p>
          <p>5.  If, within the sixty (60) days after the Secretary-General receives a request made under paragraph 2, the disputing Party fails or the disputing investors fail to appoint an arbitrator in accordance with paragraph 4, the Secretary-General, on request of any disputing party sought to be covered by the order, shall appoint the arbitrator</p>
          <p>Or arbitrators not yet appointed. If the disputing Party fails to appoint an arbitrator, the Secretary-General shall appoint a national of the disputing Party, and if the disputing investors fail to appoint an arbitrator, the Secretary-General shall appoint a national of the Contracting Party other than the disputing Party.</p>
          <p>6.  Where a Tribunal established under this Article is satisfied that two or more claims that have been submitted to arbitration under paragraph 2 of Article 27 have a question of law or fact in common, and arise out of the same events or circumstances, the Tribunal may, in the interest of fair and efficient resolution of the claims, and after hearing the disputing parties, by order:</p>
          <p>(a)  assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine together, all or part of the claims;</p>
          <p>(b)  assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine one or more claims, the determination of which it considers would assist in the resolution of the other claims; or</p>
          <p>(c)  instruct one of the Tribunals previously established under Article 30 to assume jurisdiction over and to hear and determine together, all or part of the claims, provided that;</p>
          <p>(i)  that Tribunal, at the request of any disputing investor not previously a disputing party before that Tribunal, shall be reconstituted with its original members except for the arbitrator for the disputing investors who shall be appointed pursuant to subparagraph 4(a) and paragraph 5; and</p>
          <p>(ii)  that Tribunal shall decide whether any prior hearing shall be repeated.</p>
          <p>7.  Where a Tribunal has been established under this Article, a disputing investor that has submitted a claim to arbitration under paragraph 2 of Article 27 but that has not been named in a request made under paragraph 2, may make a written request to the Tribunal established under this Article that it be included in any order made under paragraph 6 and shall specify in the request:</p>
          <p>(a)  the name and address of the disputing investor;</p>
          <p>(b)  the nature of the order sought; and</p>
          <p>(c)  the grounds on which the order is sought.</p>
          <p>8.  A Tribunal established under this Article shall conduct its proceedings in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, except as modified by this Chapter.</p>
          <p>9.  As regards the claims over which a Tribunal established under this Article has assumed jurisdiction pursuant to the order referred to in subparagraphs 6(a) and (b), Tribunals established under Article 30 shall not have jurisdiction. As regards the claims over which a Tribunal established under Article 30 has assumed jurisdiction pursuant to the order of the Tribunal established under this Article under subparagraph 6 (c), the other Tribunals established under Article 30 shall not have jurisdiction.</p>
          <p>10.  On application of a disputing party, a Tribunal established under this Article, pending its decision under paragraph 6, may order that the proceedings of a Tribunal established under Article 30 be stayed, unless the latter Tribunal has already suspended its proceedings.</p>

        <div type="article" num="38" title="Draft awards">
          <p>In any investment dispute submitted to arbitration under this Chapter, at the request of a disputing party, a Tribunal shall, before rendering a decision or award, submit to the disputing parties a proposed decision or award. Within sixty (60) days after the date of submission of the proposed decision or award, the disputing parties may submit written comments to the Tribunal concerning any aspect of the draft decision or award. The Tribunal shall consider any such comments and render its decision or award within one hundred and five (105) days of the date of submission of the proposed decision or award.</p>

          <p>A Tribunal may also award costs including attorney's fees in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.</p>
          <p>2.  Subject to paragraph 1, when a claim under subparagraph 2(b) of Article 27 is submitted:</p>

          <p>(b)  an award of monetary damages and any applicable interest shall provide that the sum be paid to the enterprise.</p>

The disputing Party shall carry out as soon as possible the provisions of the award and provide in its Area for the enforcement of the award in accordance with its relevant laws and regulations.</p>
          <p>2.  If the disputing Party fails to abide by or comply with an award, upon a request of the Contracting Party other than the disputing Party, an arbitration board in conformity with Article 24 may be established. The requesting Party may seek in such proceedings:</p>
          <p>(a)  a determination that the failure to abide by or comply with the final award is inconsistent with the obligations of this Agreement; and</p>
          <p>(b)  a recommendation to the disputing Party to abide by or comply with the award.</p>
