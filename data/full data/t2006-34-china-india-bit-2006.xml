      <div type="annex" title="Protocol to the agreement between the republic of india and the people's republic of china on promotion and protection of investments">
        <p>On the signing of the Agreement between the Republic of India and the People's Republic of China on Promotion and Protection of Investments, the undersigned representatives have agreed on the following provisions which constitute an integral part of the Agreement.</p>
        <p>
          <b>I. Ad Article 4, Paragraphs 1 and 2</b>
        </p>
        <p>1.  In respect of the People's Republic of China, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 4 do not apply to:</p>
        <p>(a) Any existing non-conforming measures maintained within its territory;</p>
        <p>(b) The continuation of any non-conforming measure referred to in sub-paragraph (a);</p>
        <p>(c) An amendment to any non-conforming measure referred to in sub-paragraph (a) to the extent that the amendment does not increase the non-conformity of the measures, as it existed immediately before the amendment, with those obligations.</p>
        <p>The non-conforming measures shall be capped at the current level and it will be endeavoured to progressively remove the non-conforming measures.</p>
        <p>2. In this respect the People's Republic of China shall accord to the investors of the Republic of India treatment not less favourable than that accorded to the investors of any third State.</p>
        <p>
          <b>II. Ad Article 7</b>
        </p>
        <p>1. With regard to People's Republic of China:</p>
        <p>(a) Article 7, paragraph (1) (c) will apply provided that a loan agreement has been registered with the relevant foreign exchange administration authority;</p>
        <p>(b) Article 7 paragraph (1)(f) will apply provided that the transfer shall comply with the relevant formalities stipulated by the present Chinese laws and regulations relating to foreign exchange control;</p>
        <p>(c) To the extent that the formalities mentioned in (a) and (b) are no longer required according to the relevant provisions of Chinese law, Article 7 shall apply without restrictions.</p>
        <p>2. In this respect the People's Republic of China shall accord to the investors of the Republic of India treatment not less favourable than that accorded to the investors of any third State.</p>
        <p>3. These formalities shall not be used as a means of avoiding the Contracting Party's commitments or obligations under this Agreement.</p>
        <p>
          <b>III. Ad Article 5</b>
        </p>
        <p>With regard to the interpretation of expropriation under Article 5, the Contracting Parties confirm their shared understanding that:</p>
        <p>1. A measure of expropriation includes, apart from direct expropriation or nationalization through formal transfer of title or outright seizure, a measure or series of measures taken intentionally by a Party to create a situation whereby the investment of an investor may be rendered substantially unproductive and incapable of yielding a return without a formal transfer of title or outright seizure.</p>
        <p>2. The determination of whether a measure or a series of measures of a Party in a specific situation, constitute measures as outlined in paragraph 1 above requires a case by case, fact based inquiry that considers, among other factors:</p>
        <p>i. The economic impact of the measure or a series of measures, although the fact that a measure or series of measures by a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that expropriation or nationalization, has occurred;</p>
        <p>ii. The extent to which the measures are discriminatory either in scope or in application with respect to a Party or an investor or an enterprise;</p>
        <p>iii. The extent to which the measures or series of measures interfere with distinct, reasonable, investment-backed expectations;</p>
        <p>iv. The character and intent of the measures or series of measures, whether they are for bona fide public interest purposes or not and whether there is a reasonable nexus between them and the intention to expropriate.</p>
        <p>3. Except in rare circumstances, non-discriminatory regulatory measures adopted by a Contracting Party in pursuit of public interest, including measures pursuant to awards of general application rendered by judicial bodies, do not constitute indirect expropriation or nationalization.</p>
