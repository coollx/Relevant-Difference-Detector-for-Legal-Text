        <p>1. The term "investments" means all kinds of funds placed by the Investor of one of the Contracting Parties in the territory of the other Contracting Party, in accordance with the legislation in force in the latter. It includes, but is not limited to:</p>
        <p>(i) movable and immovable property, as well as any right of ownership in rem, including mortgage, pledge or guarantee;</p>

        <p>(vi) If the investment is made by an investor through an entity referred to in subparagraph (iii) of paragraph 3 below, in which it has an equity interest, such investor shall enjoy the benefits of this Agreement to the extent of such indirect interest provided, however, that such benefits shall not accrue if it invokes the dispute settlement mechanism provided for in another foreign investment protection agreement concluded by a Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made.</p>
        <p>The change in the form of investment does not entail a change in its nature as an investment.</p>
        <p>2. The term "income" refers to the income resulting from investments. It includes, but is not limited to, profits, capital gains, dividends, interest, royalties, fees, patents and licenses, and other similar expenses.</p>
