      <p>Intending to create and maintain favourable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party and thus to encourage new business initiatives,</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Promotion, admission">

Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension or disposal of such investments.</p>
        <p><b>(2) </b>Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord investments or returns of investors of the other Contracting Party treatment not less favourable than that which it accords to investments or returns of its own investors or to investments or returns of investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the investor concerned.</p>
        <p><b>(3) </b>Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord investors of the other Contracting Party, as regards the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments, treatment not less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the investor concerned.</p>
        <p><b>(4) </b>If a Contracting Party accords special advantages to investors of any third State by virtue of an agreement establishing a free trade area, a customs union or a common market or by virtue of an agreement on the avoidance of double taxation, it shall not be obliged to accord such advantages to investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p><b>(5) </b>The national treatment principle referred to in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this Article shall not prevent the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho from granting, within the framework of its national development policy, certain advantages exclusively to its own small and micro enterprises, such as in particular to "cottage industries".</p>

Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or became public ay knowledge, whichever is earlier. The amount of compensation shall be settled in a freely convertible currency, be paid without delay and be freely transferable. The investor affected shall have a right, under the law of the Contracting Party making the expropriation, to prompt review, by a judicial or other independent authority of that Contracting Party, of his case and of the valuation of his investment in accordance with the principles set out in this paragraph.</p>
        <p><b>(2) </b>Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its own territory, and in which investors of the other Contracting Party own shares, it shall, to the extent necessary and subject to its laws, ensure, that compensation according to paragraph (1) of this Article will be made available to such investors.</p>

        <p>Where one Contracting Party has granted any financial guarantee against non-commercial risks in regard to an investment by one of its investors in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter shall recognize the rights of the first Contracting Party by virtue of the principle of subrogation to the rights of the investor when payment has been made under this guarantee by the first Contracting Party.</p>
