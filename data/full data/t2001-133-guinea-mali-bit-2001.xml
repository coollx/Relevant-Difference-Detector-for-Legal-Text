        <p>2. Investments thus made by investors of each Contracting Party shall enjoy, at all times, in the territory of the other Contracting Party, fair and equitable treatment, protection and full security.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="National treatment">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall accord in its territory to investments of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that accorded to domestic investors or to investors of a third State, whichever is the more favourable.</p>

        <p>(i) the rights or claims of the investors of the first Contracting Party or of the institution designated by it, and the assignment to the first Contracting Party or its representative of all rights and interests of the investor so compensated;</p>
        <p>(ii) The first Contracting Party or the institution subrogated has it, as having the power to exercise the rights or claims due to the investors, and shall assume the obligations relating to the investments.</p>

        <p>3. Subrogation of the rights and obligations of an indemnified investor shall also cover transfers of payments made in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Precautionary measures">
        <p>1. This Agreement shall not prevent the application by each Contracting Party of measures necessary for the maintenance of law and order and morals, the fulfilment of its obligations in connection with the maintenance or restoration of peace and national security or the protection of its own essential security interests.</p>
        <p>2. This Agreement shall not prevent any Party from adopting special procedures relating to the establishment of investments, provided that such procedures do not violate any of the fundamental rights set out below.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Settlement of disputes between a contracting party and the investors of the other contracting party">
        <p>1. Solutions to disputes between one Contracting Party and investors of the other Party concerning the obligations of the latter Party under this Agreement with respect to investments made by investors of the former Party shall be sought, to the greatest extent possible, by negotiation.</p>
        <p>2. Should the disputes referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article not be settled within six months of negotiations, either Party shall have the right to submit the case to the competent court of the Contracting Party which is at the same time a party to the dispute.</p>
        <p>3. If the provisions of paragraph 2 of this article are not applied, either Party to the dispute shall have the right to submit the case to arbitration:</p>
        <p>(i) an ad hoc Arbitral Tribunal, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on Commercial Law (UNCITRAL);</p>
        <p>(ii) or the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), if both Contracting Parties are parties to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965.</p>
        <p>4. The decision thus pronounced shall be final and binding on both parties to the dispute and shall be enforced in accordance with the legislation in force in the Contracting Party in whose territory the investments have taken place.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Settlement of disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1. Any dispute arising out of the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be settled to the greatest extent possible by negotiation between the Parties.</p>
        <p>2. If, after six months from the beginning of the negotiations, the negotiations have not been concluded, the matter shall, at the request of either Party, be submitted to arbitration.</p>
        <p>3. The Arbitration Court referred to in paragraph 2 above shall be set up on an ad hoc basis, on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the following procedure: within three months of receipt of the request for arbitration, each of the Contracting Parties shall appoint one member of the Arbitration Court. These two members shall, within two months, appoint a third member who shall be a national of a third country. With the agreement of the two Contracting Parties, the latter shall assume the chairmanship of the arbitration.</p>
        <p>4. Should the Arbitration Court not be constituted within the time limits laid down in the preceding paragraph, either Contracting Party may, failing any other arrangement, have recourse to the International Court of Justice and request its President to make the necessary appointments. Should the President be a national of one of the Parties or be prevented from carrying out his functions, the Vice-President shall be requested to appoint the above-mentioned officials. Should the Vice-President again prove to be a national of one of the Contracting Parties or be prevented from carrying out the task entrusted to him, the request for appointment shall be addressed to the first in the order of precedence - members of the International Court of Justice who are not nationals of any of the Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>5. The Arbitration Court shall take its decisions on the basis of the provisions of this Agreement and in accordance with the generally recognized principles and rules of international law. The decisions of the arbitration shall be taken by a majority of votes. They shall be final and binding on both Contracting Parties. The Court is called upon to establish its own rules of procedure.</p>
        <p>6. Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of its representative and of the latter's participation in the work of the arbitration. The costs of the chairmanship and other costs inherent in the arbitration shall be borne equally by the two Parties.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Application of other provisions">
        <p>Should the national laws of the Contracting Parties, or existing or future agreements between the Contracting Parties or international agreements signed by the Contracting Parties contain provisions reserving to investments made by investors of any of them, a more favourable treatment than that provided for in this Agreement, the laws and agreements referred to above shall - to the extent that they are more favourable - take precedence.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="12" title="Consultations">
        <p>If necessary, the representatives of the Contracting Parties shall meet for consultations on matters concerning the application of this Agreement. Consultations shall take place on the proposal of one of the Parties, at a place and date to be agreed through diplomatic channels.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="13" title="Entry into force, duration and expiration of the agreement">
        <p>1. This Agreement, which is subject to ratification, shall enter into force on the day of the exchange of the instruments of ratification.</p>
        <p>2. This Agreement shall be concluded for a period of ten years and shall be tacitly renewable for further successive periods of five years unless one of the Contracting Parties has informed another in writing at least twelve months before the expiry date that it wishes to terminate it.</p>
        <p>3. For investments made before the date of expiry of this Agreement, the provisions laid down in Articles 1 to 12 shall continue to apply for a period of ten years after that date.</p>
