      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Settlement of disputes between a contracting party and a national of the other contracting party">
        <p>1 Where a dispute concerning an investment arises between a Contracting Party and a national of the other Contracting Party in the territory of that Party, the Parties to the dispute shall first of all settle the dispute by consultation and negotiation.</p>
        <p>2 If the dispute can not be settled in accordance with paragraph (1) of this Article, within three (3) months from the date of submission of the request for consultation and negotiation, each Contracting Party agrees to submit to the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes with a view to settlement by conciliation or arbitration in accordance with the Convention for the Settlement of Investment Differences between States and Nationals of other States, open for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965 any dispute of a legal nature between that Contracting Party and a national of the other Contracting Party relating to an investment made by that national in the territory of the first Contracting Party concerned.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1 Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall, as far as possible, be settled through diplomatic channels.</p>
        <p>2 Where a dispute between the Contracting Parties can not be settled by this means, it shall be submitted to an arbitral tribunal at the request of one of the Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>3 The arbitral tribunal shall be constituted, in each individual case, as follows:</p>
        <p>itemized Within two months of receipt of a request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint a member of the tribunal;</p>

        <p>5 The arbitral tribunal shall decide by a majority of votes. The decision shall be binding on both Contracting Parties. Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation during the arbitral proceedings; the costs of the Chairman and the other costs shall be borne equally by the Contracting Parties. It is, however, permissible for the court to order in its decision that a greater proportion of the costs be borne by one of the two Parties, and this award is binding on both Parties. The court rules its own procedure.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Subrogation">

As regards the transfer of payments to the Contracting Party in question by virtue of the transmission of the rights, the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 3 and of Article 4 shall apply mutatis mutandis.</p>
