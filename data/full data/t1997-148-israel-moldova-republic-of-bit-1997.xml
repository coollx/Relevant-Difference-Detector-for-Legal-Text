        <p>1. For the purpose of solving disputes with respect to investments, between an investor of a Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party, consultations between the parties to the dispute and other remedies will be pursued, with a view to resolving the dispute.</p>
        <p>2. If these consultations and remedies do not result in a solution within 6 (six) months from the date of request for settlement, the investor may submit the dispute, at his choice, for settlement to:</p>
        <p>a) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), instituted by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and the Nationals of Other States, of Washington D.C. of March 18, 1965, from such time as the Republic of Moldova becomes a party to the Convention.</p>

        <p>3. Neither Contracting Party shall pursue, through the diplomatic channel, any dispute referred to ICSID or to international arbitration unless the other Contracting Party does not comply with the decision of ICSID or an international arbitration.</p>

      <div type="article" num="9" title="Disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1. Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement should, if possible, be settled through the diplomatic channel, which may include, if both Contracting Parties so desire, referral to a 3ilateral Commission composed of representatives of both Contracting Parties.</p>

        <p>3. Such an arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way: within two months of the receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the tribunal.

The Chairman shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>4. If, within the periods specified in paragraph (3) of this Article, the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the Chairman of the Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris (hereinafter: the "ICC") to make any necessary appointments. If the Chairman is a national of either Contracting Party or is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, then one of the Vice-Chairmen who is not a national of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-Chairmen are nationals of either Contracting Party or are otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, then the member of the Court next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party and is not otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, shall make the appointments.</p>
        <p>5. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be binding on both Contracting Parties. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings; the cost of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. The tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If one contracting Party or its designated Agency (hereinafter: the "First Contracting Party") makes a payment under an indemnity given in respect of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party (hereinafter: the "Second Contracting Party"), the Second Contracting Party shall recognize:</p>
        <p>(a) The assignment to the First Contracting Party by law or by legal transaction of all the rights and claims of the party indemnified; and</p>
        <p>(b) That the First Contracting Party is entitled to exercise such rights and enforce such claims by virtue of subrogation, to the same extent as the party indemnified, and shall assume the obligations related to the investment.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Application of other rules">
        <p>If the provisions of law of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement contain rules, whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors of one Contracting Party to treatment more favorable than is provided for by the present Agreement, such rules shall to the extent that they are more favorable prevail over the present Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="12" title="Application of the agreement">
        <p>The provisions of this Agreement shall also apply to investments made before the entry into force of this Agreement.</p>
      </div>

        <p>Each Contracting Party shall notify the other Contracting Party in writing through the diplomatic channel of the completion of its internal legal procedures required for bringing this Agreement into force. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the latter notification.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="14" title="Duration and termination">
        <p>This Agreement shall remain in force for a period of 10 (ten) years. Thereafter it shall continue in force until the expiration of 12 (twelve) months from the date on which either Contracting Party shall have given written notice of termination to the other. In respect of investments made while this Agreement is in force, its provisions shall continue in effect with respect to such investments for a period of 10 (ten) years after the date of termination and without prejudice to the application thereafter of the rules of general international law.</p>
