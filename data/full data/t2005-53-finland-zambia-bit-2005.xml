        <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investments and returns of investments of investors of the other Contracting Party fair and equitable treatment and full and constant protection and security.</p>
        <p>3. Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory impair by unreasonable or arbitrary measures the acquisition, expansion, operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment and sale or other disposal of investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Treatment of investments">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall accord to investors of the other Contracting Party and to their investments, a treatment no less favourable than the treatment it accords to its own investors and their investments with respect to the acquisition, expansion, operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment and sale or other disposal of investments.</p>
        <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall accord to investors of the other Contracting Party and to their investments, a treatment no less favourable than the treatment it accords to investors of the most favoured nation and to their investments with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, and sale or other disposal of investments.</p>
        <p>3. Each Contracting Party shall accord to investors of the other Contracting Party and to their investments the better of the treatments required by paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of this Article, whichever is the more favourable to the investors or investments.</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="Exemptions">

      <div type="article" num="5" title="Expropriation">
        <p>1. Investments by investors of a Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall not be expropriated, nationalised or subjected to any other measures, direct or indirect, having an effect equivalent to expropriation or nationalisation such as freezing of assets or blocking an investment (hereinafter referred to as "expropriation"), except for a purpose which is in the public interest, on a non-discriminatory basis, in accordance with due process of law, and against adequate and effective compensation without delay.</p>
        <p>2. Such compensation shall represent the current value of the investments affected and shall amount to the value of the expropriated investment at the time immediately before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier.</p>
        <p>3. The compensation value shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of valuation and shall be fully realisable and paid without any restriction or delay. It shall be immediately transferable in a convertible currency and include interest at the prevalent commercial rate for the currency of payment from the date of dispossession of the expropriated property until the date of actual payment.</p>
        <p>4. The Contracting Parties affirm that when a Contracting Party expropriates the assets or a part thereof of a company which has been incorporated or constituted in accordance with the law in force in its territory, and in which investors of the other Contracting Party own shares, or when the object of expropriation is a joint venture constituted in the territory of a Contracting Party, the host Contracting Party shall ensure that the articles of association and possible other relevant documents of the companies or joint-ventures concerned, as they exist at the time of expropriation, are fully respected.</p>
        <p>5. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 9 of this Agreement, the investor whose investments are expropriated shall have the right to prompt review of its case and of valuation of its investments in accordance with the principles set out in this Article, by a judicial or other competent authority of the host Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Compensation for losses">
        <p>1. Investors of one Contracting Party whose investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party suffer losses owing to war or other armed conflict, a state of national emergency, revolt, insurrection or riot in the territory of the latter Contracting Party, shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement, a treatment no less favourable than the one accorded by the latter Contracting Party to its own investors or investors of the most favoured nation, whichever, according to the investor, is the more favourable.</p>
        <p>2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1 of this Article, investors of one Contracting Party who, in any of the situations referred to in that paragraph, suffer losses in the territory of the other Contracting Party resulting from:</p>
        <p>(a) Requisitioning of its investment or a part thereof by the latter's armed forces or authorities, or</p>
        <p>(b) Destruction of its investment or a part thereof by the latter's armed forces or authorities, which was not required by the necessity of the situation,</p>
        <p>Shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party restitution or compensation, which in either case shall be adequate and effective and paid without delay. With respect to compensation the value shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of valuation and shall be fully realisable. It shall include interest at the prevalent commercial rate for the currency of payment from the date of requisitioning or destruction until the date of actual payment.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Free transfer">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall ensure to investors of the other Contracting Party the free transfer, into and out of its territory, of their investments and transfer payments related to investments. Such payments shall include in particular, though not exclusively:</p>
        <p>(a) Principal and additional amounts to maintain, develop or increase the investment;</p>
        <p>(b) Returns;</p>
        <p>(c) Proceeds obtained from the total or partial sale or disposal of an investment, including the sale of shares;</p>
        <p>(d) Amounts required for the payment of expenses, which arise from the operation of the investment, such as loans repayments, payment of royalties, management fees, licence fees or other similar expenses;</p>
        <p>(e) Compensation payable pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 8 and 9;</p>
        <p>(f) Earnings and other remuneration of personnel engaged from abroad and working in connection with an investment.</p>
        <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall further ensure that the transfers referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be made without any restriction in a freely convertible currency of the choice of the investor and at the prevailing market rate of exchange applicable on the date of transfer to the currency to be transferred and shall be immediately transferable.</p>
        <p>3. In the absence of a market for foreign exchange, the rate to be used shall be the most recent exchange rate for the conversions of currencies into Special Drawing Rights.</p>
        <p>4. In case of a delay in transfer caused by the host Contracting Party, the transfer shall also include interest at a commercial rate established on a market basis for the currency in question from the date on which the transfer was requested until the date of actual transfer and shall be borne by that Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>5. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, a Contracting Party concerned may, in the event of serious balance-of-payments difficulties or threat thereof, adopt restrictions on transfer payments related to investments consistent with its other obligations under international law. Such restrictions shall be equitable, non-discriminatory and applied in good faith to avoid adverse effects on the principle of free transfer ensured by this Agreement. The duration of the restrictions shall be applied only for a period that is absolutely necessary but shall in no case exceed six (6) months.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If a Contracting Party or its designated agency makes a payment under an indemnity, guarantee or contract of insurance against noncommercial risk given in respect of an investment of an investor in the territory of the other Contracting Party under a system established by law, governmental regulation or contract, the latter Contracting Party shall recognise the assignment of any right or claim of such an investor to the former Contracting Party or its designated agency, and the right of the former Contracting Party or its designated agency to exercise by virtue of subrogation any such right and claim to the same extent as its predecessor in title.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Disputes between an investor and a contracting party">
        <p>1. Any dispute arising directly from an investment between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party should be settled amicably between the two parties to the dispute.</p>
        <p>2. If the dispute has not been settled within three (3) months from the date on which it was raised in writing, the dispute may, at the choice of the investor, be submitted to:</p>
        <p>(a) The competent courts of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made; or</p>
        <p>(b) Arbitration by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), established pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965 (hereinafter referred to as the "Centre"), if the Centre is available; or</p>

Once the investor has submitted the dispute to one of the competent courts of the host Contracting Party as stipulated in paragraph 2(a) of this Article or to one of the arbitration procedures stipulated in paragraph 2(b) to 2(e) of this Article, the choice of the procedure is final and cannot be referred to further arbitration.</p>
        <p>4. Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute between it and an investor of the other Contracting Party to arbitration in accordance with this Article.</p>
        <p>5. Neither of the Contracting Parties, which is a party to a dispute, can raise an objection, at any phase of the arbitration procedure or of the execution of an arbitral award, on account of the fact that the investor, which is the other party to the dispute, has received an indemnification covering a part or the whole of its losses by virtue of an insurance.</p>
        <p>6. The award shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute and shall be executed in accordance with national law of the Contracting Party in whose territory the award is relied upon, by the competent authorities of the Contracting Party by the date indicated in the award.</p>

        <p>1. Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation and application of this Agreement shall, as far as possible, be settled through diplomatic channels.</p>

        <p>3. Such an Arbitral Tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way. Within two (2) months of the receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the Tribunal. Those two members shall then select a national of a third State who on approval by the two Contracting Parties shall be appointed Chairman of the Tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within four (4) months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>4. If the necessary appointments have not been made within the periods specified in paragraph 3 of this Article, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party or is not otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5. The Arbitral Tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. The decisions of the Tribunal shall be final and binding on both Contracting Parties. Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of the member appointed by that Contracting Party and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings. Both Contracting Parties shall assume an equal share of the costs of the Chairman, as well as any other costs. The Tribunal may make a different decision regarding the sharing of the costs. In all other respects, the Arbitral Tribunal shall determine its own rules of procedure.</p>
        <p>6. Issues subject to dispute referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be decided in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the generally recognised principles of international law.</p>

        <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation it may have with regard to a specific investment of an investor of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="13" title="Application of the agreement">

      <div type="article" num="14" title="General derogations">

        <p>3. The provisions of this Article shall not apply to Article 7 paragraph l.(e) of this Agreement.</p>

        <p>2. Nothing in this Agreement shall require a Contracting Party to furnish or allow access to any confidential or proprietary information, including information concerning particular investors or investments, the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement or be contrary to its laws protecting confidentiality or prejudice legitimate commercial interests of particular investors.</p>
