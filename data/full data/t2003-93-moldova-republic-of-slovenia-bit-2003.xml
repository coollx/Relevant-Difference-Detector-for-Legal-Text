      </div>

        <p>2. Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination by a Contracting Party, or a disguised investment restriction, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Contracting Party from taking any measure necessary for the maintenance of public order.</p>
        <p>3. The provisions of this Article shall not apply to Article 5, Article 6 or paragraph 1(e) of Article 7.</p>

      <div type="article" num="16" title="Entry into force, duration and termination">
        <p>1.
