        <p>1.

        <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investors of the other Contracting Party, as regards management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investment, treatment which is fair and equitable and not less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable.</p>
        <p>3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to the investors of the other Contracting Party and their investments special rights accorded to nationals or investments of nationals of any third State by virtue of an agreement establishing a free-trade area, a customs union, a common market, a common labour market or a regional economic integration.</p>

        <p>2.  Without prejudice to paragraph 1 of this Article, investors of one Contracting Party who in any of the events referred to in that paragraph suffer losses in the territory of the other Contracting Party resulting from:</p>

        <p>a)  the initial capital and additional amounts to maintain or increase the investment;</p>
        <p>b)  profits, interest, dividends and other current income or returns;</p>

        <p>4.  In case of serious balance of payments difficulties or the threat thereof, each Contracting Party may temporarily restrict transfers provided that such a Contracting Party implements measures or a programme in accordance with internationally recognized standards. These restrictions should be imposed on an equitable, nondiscriminatory and in good faith basis.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Transparency">
