      <p>On signing the Treaty concer ning the Reciprocal Enc ouragement and Protection of Investments, the Arab Republic of Egypt and the United States of America, have, in addition, agreed on the following provisions which should be regarded as an integral part of this Treaty:</p>
      <p>1. Each Party reserves the right to deny t he benefits of this Treat y to any company of either Party, or its af filiates or subsidiari es, if nationals of any third country control such company, affiliate or subsidiary; pr ovided that, whenever one Party concludes that the benefits of this Treaty should not be extended fo r this reason, it shall promptly consult with the other Party to seek a mutually satisfactory resolution of this matter.</p>
      <p>2. "Control" means to have a substantial sh are of ownership rights and the ability to exercise decisive influence. Differences as to the existence of control shall be resolved according to the provisions of Article VIII.</p>
      <p>3. (a) The treatment accorded by the Unit ed States to nationals or companies of Egypt under the provisions of Article II(l) and (2) shall in any State of the United States or other territory, po ssession, or political or administrative subdivision of the United States be the treatm ent accorded therein to residents of or companies incorporated, constituted or otherwise duly organized in other States of the United States or territories, possessions, or politic al or administrative subdivisions of the United States. (b) The treatment accorded by Egypt to nat ionals and companies of the United States with respect to the establishment and acquisi tion of investments in limited sensitive geographic areas designated for exclusive Egyptian investment shall be no less favorable then the treatment it accords to investments of nationa ls and companies of any third country. Egypt reserves the right to modify the areas covered, provided that such areas will be kept to a minimum and will not substantially impair the investment opportunities of United Stat es nationals and companies.</p>
      <p>4. The provisions of Article II, paragraph 3, relating to most favored nation treatment, shall not apply to advantages accorded by either Party to nationals or companies of a third country by virtue of a specific se curity or regional arrangement, including regional customs unions or free trade areas. Further, these provisions do not apply to the ownership of real estate. The provisions of Article II paragraph 1, relating to most favored nation treatment, shall not be construed to oblige one Party to extend to nationals or companies of the other the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege which may be extended by the former Party by virtue of a customs union or in the field of housing. Mo reover, with regard to right s to engage in mining on the public domain, each Party retains the right to accord to nationals or companies of the other Party treatment wh ich is like or similar to that accorded by the other Party to nationals or companies of the first Party.</p>
      <p>5. It is understood that this Treaty does not derogate from the rights of either Party regarding the establishment of qualifications as for the practice of professions, including law and accountancy. These qualificat ions may confine the practice of such professions to nationals or companies of. a Party, provided that they are applied on a nondiscriminatory basis; and prov ided, further, that such nationality requirements do not derogate from the right of nationals and co mpanies of either Party, pursuant to Article II (5)(b) to engage professional and technical pers onnel of their choice to render professional and techni cal services necessary for the internal planning and operation of the investment.</p>
      <p>6 This Treaty, and in particular, the provis ions of Article II, paragraph 5(b) shall be subject to the provis ions of Article X.</p>
      <p>7. With respect to Articl e II (6), performance requirem ents are conditions imposed which would require an investor to export a minimum percentage of final product or to source some inputs locally.</p>
      <p>8. With regard to Article III, paragraph l(d) the term "prompt" does not necessarily mean instantaneous. The intent is that the Party diligently and expeditiously carry out any necessary formalities.</p>
      <p>9. With regard to Article III, paragraph 1, the phrase "events that constituted or resulted in the expropriatory action" refers to conduct attributable to the expropriatory Party and not to conduct of the national or company. The inclusion of paragraph (e) in Article III, paragraph 1, is without prejudi ce to the measure of compensation due in the event of expropriation.</p>
      <p>10. The Parties recognize that restrictions on transfers abroad of sales or liquidation proceeds of an investment will adversely affect future capital inflow s, contrary to the spirit of this Treaty and the interests of the Party imposing those restrictions. Nevertheless, the Parties recognize that it is possible that the Arab Republic of Egypt may find its foreign exchange reserves at a ve ry low level. In these circumstances, the Arab Republic of Egypt ma y temporarily delay transfers required under Article V, Paragraph l(f), but only: (i) in a manner not less favorable than that accorded to comparable transfers to investor s of third countries; (ii) to the extent and for the time period n to restore its reserves to a mini mally acceptable level, but in no case for period of time longer than that permitted by the provisions of Law 43 in force on the date of signature of this Treat y; and (iii) after providing the investor an opportunity to invest the sales or liquidation proceeds in a manner which will pr eserve their real value free of exchange risk until transfer occurs.</p>
      <p>11. Concerning Article VII (3 )(a)(ii), it is understood that the Parties to the dispute may Previously agree to submission of the dispute to the jurisdiction of domestic courts and tribunals. The Parties will main tain a nondiscriminatory policy regarding the inclusion and implementation of such provisions in any investment contract.</p>
      <p>12. With regard to the Anne x, the exceptions noted by the Arab Republic of Egypt under "commercial activity" do not include integrated operations which combine production and sales activities for their products.</p>
      <p>13. Recognizing that internat ional financial markets and inst itutions further stimulate the process of economic development th rough the international transmission of investment and associated technology, each Party undertakes to maintain a favorable environment for investment by na tionals or companies of the other Party in the insurance and banking sectors. Therefore, each Party accords to investments by nationals or companies of the other Party in investm ent banks, merchant-banks and reinsurance companies whose activities are confined to transactions in foreign currencies treatment no less favorable t han that accorded under existing laws and regulations to investments by its own nationals and compani es or to investments by nationals or companies of any third country, whichever is the more favorable. Both Parties agree to hold future discussions concerning the expansion of investment possibilities in these sectors by nationals or companies of either Pa rty in the territory of the other Party.</p>
