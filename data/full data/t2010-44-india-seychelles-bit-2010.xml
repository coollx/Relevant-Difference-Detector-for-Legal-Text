      <div type="annex" title="Interpretation of expropriation in article 5 (expropriation)">
        <p>1.  A measure of expropriation includes, apart from direct expropriation or nationalization through formal transfer of title or outright seizure, a measure or series of measures taken intentionally by a Party to create a situation whereby the investment of an investor may be rendered substantially unproductive and incapable of yielding a return without a formal transfer of title or outright seizure.</p>
        <p>2.  The determination of whether a measure or a series of measures ol a Party in a specific situation, constitutes measures as outlined in paragraph 1 above requires a case by case, fact based inquiry that considers, among other factors:</p>
        <p>(i)  the economic impact of the measure or a series of measures, although the fact that a measure or series of measures by a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that expropriation or nationalization, has occurred;</p>
        <p>(ii)  the extent to which the measures are discriminatory either in scope or in application with respect to a Party or an investor or an enterprise;</p>
        <p>(iii)  the extent to which the measures or series of measures interfere with distinct, reasonable, investment-backed expectations;</p>
        <p>(ivj the character and intent of the measures or series of measures, whether they are for bona fide public interest purposes or not and whether there is a reasonable nexus between them and the intention to expropriate.</p>
        <p>2.  Except in rare circumstances non-discriminatory measures taken by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives including health, safety and environmental concerns, do not constitute expropriation or nationalization.</p>
        <p>4.  Actions and awards by judicial bodies of a Party that are designed, applied or issued in public interest including those designed to address health, safety and environmental concerns, do not constitute expropriation or nationalization.</p>
