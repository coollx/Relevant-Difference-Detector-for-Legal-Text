    </title>
    <preamble>
      <p>The Government of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Government of the Republic of Albania,</p>
      <p>Desiring to intensify economic cooperation to the mutual benefit of both countries and to maintain favourable, fair and equitable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party,</p>
      <p>Recognizing that the promotion and reciprocal protection of such investments are important factors for the expansion of the economic relations between the two Contracting Parties and stimulate investment initiatives,</p>
      <p>Have agreed as follows:</p>
    </preamble>
    <body>
      <div type="article" num="1" title="Definitions">
        <p>For the purposes of this Agreement:</p>
        <p>(1) "investment" shall mean any kind of asset, invested by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, provided that the investment has been made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the other Contracting Party, and shall include in particular, though not exclusively:</p>
        <p>(a) Movable and immovable property, tangible and intangible property as well as any other property rights, such as mortgage, lien, pledge, usufruct and similar rights;</p>
        <p>(b) A company, shares in the capital stock of a company or any other form of participation in a company;</p>
        <p>(c) Title to money or any performance having an economic value;</p>
        <p>(d) Intellectual property rights, technical processes, trade names, know-how, goodwill and other similar rights; and</p>
        <p>(e) Any right or licence conferred by law, administrative decisions or under contract to undertake economic activity, including rights to search for, develop, extract or exploit natural resources.</p>
        <p>A change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect their character as investments.</p>
        <p>Equipment that under a leasing agreement is placed at the disposal of a lessee in the territory of one Contracting Party by a lessor being a national of the other Contracting Party or a legal person having its seat in the territory of that Contracting Party, shall be treated no less favourably than an investment.</p>
        <p>(2) "investor" shall mean:</p>
        <p>(a) Any natural person who is a national of a Contracting Party in accordance with its laws;</p>
        <p>(b) Any legal person having its seat in the territory of the Republic of Albania: and</p>
        <p>(c) Any legal person having its seat in the Kingdom of Sweden, or in a third country with a predominant interest of a Swedish investor.</p>
        <p>(3) "returns" shall mean the amounts yielded by an investment and in particular, though not exclusively, includes profit, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties or fees.</p>
        <p>(4) "territory" shall mean the territory of each Contracting Party, including the territorial waters, as well as the exclusive economic zone the seabed and subsoil, over which the Contracting Party exercises, in accordance with international law, sovereign rights and jurisdiction.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion and protection of investments">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall, subject to its general policy in the field of foreign investment, promote in its territory investments by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall admit such investments in accordance with its legislation.</p>
        <p>(2) In accordance with the laws and regulations relating to the entry and sojourn of aliens, individuals working for an investor of one Contracting Party, as well as members of their household, shall be permitted to enter into, remain on and leave the territory of the other Contracting Party for the purpose of carrying out activities associated with investments in the territory of the latter Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>(3) In order to create favourable conditions for assessing the financial position and results of activities related to investments in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties, this Contracting Party shall - notwithstanding its own national requirements for bookkeeping and auditing - permit the investment to be subject also to bookkeeping and auditing according to standards which the investor is subjected to by his national requirements or according to internationally accepted standards (e.g. International Accounting Standards (IAS) drawn up by the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC)). The result of such accountancy and audit shall be freely transferable to the investor.</p>
        <p>(4) The investments made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory they are undertaken, enjoy the full protection of this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Treatment of investments">

        <p>(2) Each Contracting Party shall at all times ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof as well as the acquisition of goods and services and the sale of their production, through unreasonable or discriminatory measures.</p>

        <p>(4) The provisions of Paragraph (1) of this Article shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to investors of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatement, preference or privilege resulting from any international agreement or arragement relating wholly or mainly to tazation or any domstic legislation relating wholly or mainly to tazation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="Expropriation and compensation">

        <p>(b) The measures are distinct and not discriminatory; and</p>

Resulting payments shall be transferable without delay in a freely convertible currency.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Transfers">

        <p>(b) The proceeds from a total or partial sale or liquidation of any investment by an investor of the other Contracting Party;</p>
        <p>(c) Funds in repayment of loans; and</p>
        <p>(d) The earnings of individuals, not being its nationals, who are allowed to work in connection with an investment in its territory and other amounts appropriated for the coverage of expenses connected with the management of the investment.</p>
        <p>(2) Any transfer referred to in this Agreement shall be effected at the official exchange rate prevailing on the day the transfer is made.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If a Contracting Party or its designated agency makes a payment to any of its investors under a guarantee it has granted in respect of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall, without prejudice to the rights of the former Contracting Party under Article 8, recognize the transfer of any right or title of such an investor to the former Contracting Party or its designated agency and the subrogation of the former Contracting Party or its designated agency to any such right or title.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Disputes between an investor and a contracting party">
        <p>(1) Any dispute concerning an investment between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party shall, if possible, be settled amicably.</p>
        <p>(2) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Washington Convention of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States any such dispute which has not been settled within six months following the date, on which the dispute has been raised by either party. If the parties to such a dispute have different opinions as to whether conciliation or arbitration is the more appropriate method of settlement, the investor shall have the right to choose.</p>
        <p>(3) For the purpose of this Article, any legal person which is constituted in accordance with the legislation of one Contracting Party and in which before a dispute arises the majority of shares are owned by investors of the other Contracting Party shall be treated, in accordance with Article 25(2) (b) of the said Washington Convention, as a legal person of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>(1) Any dispute between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall, if possible, be settled by negotiations between the Governments of the two Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>(2) If the dispute cannot thus be settled within six months, following the date on which such negotiations were requested by either Contracting Party, it shall at the request of either Contracting Party be submitted to an arbitration tribunal.</p>
        <p>(3) The arbitration tribunal shall be set up from case to case, each Contracting Party appointing one member. These two members shall then agree upon a national of a third State as their chairman, to be appointed by the Governments of the two Contracting Parties. The members shall be appointed within two months, and the chairman within four months, from the date either Contracting Party has advised the other Contracting Party of its wish to submit the dispute to an arbitration tribunal.</p>
        <p>(4) If the time limits referred to in Paragraph (3) of this Article have not been complied with, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other relevant arrangement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>(5) If the President of the International Court of Justice is prevented from discharging the function provided for in Paragraph (4) of this Article or is a national of either Contracting Party, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is prevented from discharging the said function or is a national of either Contracting Party, the most senior member of the Court who is not incapacitated or a national of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>(6) The arbitration tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes, the decision being final and binding on the Contracting Parties. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of the member appointed by that Contracting Party as well as the costs for its representation in the arbitration proceedings; the cost of the chairman as well as any other costs shall be borne in equal parts by the two Contracting Parties. The arbitration tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the Contracting Parties. In all other respects, the procedure of the arbitration tribunal shall be determined by the tribunal itself.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Application of the agreement">
