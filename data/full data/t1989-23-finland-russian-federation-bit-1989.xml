        <p>(c) The term "returns" means the amounts of money or any other asset which are yielded or should be yielded by an investment under the terms of subpara- graph (6) of this article, including in particular, profits, interest, dividends, royalties and other fees.</p>

        <p>2. Under the terms of paragraph 1 of this article, this Agreement shall apply to all investments made since | January 1946 by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party.</p>

        <p>2.

The treatment provided for in paragraph 2 of this article shall not apply to profits and advantages that either Contracting Party grants in respect of the investments and returns of third-country investors on the basis of agreements regarding an economic customs union, a free trade zone, international economic cooperation or the elimination of double taxation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="Protection of investments">

Should this occur, the procedure established by the legislation in force in that territory shall be applied and appropriate compensation paid.</p>
        <p>3. Such measures shall not be discriminatory in nature.</p>
        <p>4, The compensation referred to in paragraph 2 of this article shall amount to the real value of the investment expropriated and shall be calculated on the basis of world prices in force at the time immediately prior to the adoption of measures to expropriate the investments or immediately before the decision to adopt such measures became public knowledge. Compensation shall be paid in freely convertible currency at the official foreign exchange rate applicable at the time the value was assessed, unless otherwise agreed upon at the time of initial investment. The amount of compensation shall be transferred promptly and within the limits normally required to conduct transfers, but no later than three months from the adoption of measures under the provisions of paragraph 2 of this article. Compensation shall include interest calculated from the date the actual value of the expropriated investment was assessed up until the date of payment at the rate of interest legally established by the Contracting Party which introduced the compulsory expropriation measures. In the absence of such a rate, the normal commercial interest rate applied by the central bank of the Contracting Party which introduced the obligatory measures shall apply.</p>
        <p>5. Any investor affected by such compulsory measures shall be entitled, under the law of the Contracting Party which introduced the compulsory measures, to receive from the appropriate agency or institution of that Contracting Party a prompt and impartial assessment of the value of the expropriated investment under the provisions of paragraph 4 of this article.</p>
