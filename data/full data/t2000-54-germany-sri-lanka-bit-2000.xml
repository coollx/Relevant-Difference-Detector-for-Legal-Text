    </conclusion>
    <attachments>
      <p>On signing the Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka concerning the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, the plenipotentiaries have, in addition, agreed on the following provisions, which is an integral part of the said Treaty:</p>
      <p>(1) Ad Article 1</p>
      <p>(a) Retums from the investment and, in the event of their reinvestment, the retums therefrom shall enjoy the same protection as the investment.</p>
      <p>(b) Without prejudice to any other method of determining nationality, in particular any person in possession of a national passport issued by the competent authorities of the Contracting State concerned shall be deemed to be a national of that State.</p>
      <p>(2) Ad Article 2</p>
      <p>(a) Investments made, in accordance with the legislation of either Contracting State, within the territory of that Contracting State by nationals or companies of the other Contracting State shall enjoy the full protection of the Treaty.</p>
      <p>b) The Treaty shall also apply to the areas of the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf insofar as international law penmits the Contracting State concerned to exercise sovereign rights or jurisdiction in these areas.</p>
      <p>(3) Ad Article 3</p>
      <p>(a) The following shall more particularly, though not exclusively, be deemed "activity" within the meaning of Article 3 (2): the management, maintenance, use and enjoyment of an investment. The following shall, in particular, be deemed 'treatment less favourable" within the meaning of Article 3: unequal treatment in the case of restrictions on the purchase of raw or auxiliary materials, of energy orfuel or of means of production or operation of any kind, unequal treatment in the case of impeding the marketing of products inside or outside the country, as well as any other measures having similar effects. Measures that have to be taken for reasons of public security and order, public health or morality shall not be deemed "treatment less favourable" within the meaning of Article 3. However, the Contracting States note that Sri Lanka has laws and regulations providing certain incentives to nationals and companies which meet certain economic performance criteria such as those which export or contribute new technology. Providing of such incentives on a non-discriminatory basis will not amount to "treatment less favourable" within the meaning of Article 3.</p>
      <p>(b) The provisions of Article 3 do not oblige a Contracting State to extend to natural persons or companies resident in the territory of the other Contracting State tax privileges, tax exemptions and tax reductions which according to its tax laws are granted only to natural persons and companies resident in its territory.</p>
      <p>(c) The Contracting States shall within the framework of their national legislation give sympathetic conslderaticn to applications for the entry and sojourn of persons of either Contracting State who wish to enter the tern tory of the other Contracting State In connection with an investment: the same shall apply to employed persons of either Contracting State who in connection with an investment wish to enter the territory of the other Contracting State and sojourn there to take up employment. Applications for work permits shall also be given sympathetic consideration.</p>
      <p>(d) The word "controlled" used in Article 3 (1) means full participation in substantive decisions of the company concerned, including the appointment of key managerial personnel, thus having an effective influence on the investment.</p>
      <p>(4) Ad Article 7</p>
      <p>A transfer shall be deemed to have been made "without delay" within the meaning of Article 7 (1) if effected within such period as is normally required for the completion of transfer formalities. The said period shall commence on the day on which the relevant request has been submitted and may on no account exceed two months.</p>
      <p>(5) Whenever goods or persons connected with an investment are to be transported into each other's territory, each Contracting State shall neither exclude nor hinder transport enterprises of the other Contracting State. Each Contracting State shall further facilitate permits as required to carry out such transport in accordance with applicable laws and procedures. This shall include the transport of</p>
      <p>(a) Goods directly intended for an investment within the meaning of the Treaty or acquired in the territory of either Contracting State or of any third State by or on behalf of an enterprise in which assets within the meaning of the Treaty are invested;</p>
      <p>(b) Persons travelling in connection with an investment.</p>
