        <p>2.

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="National treatment and most-favoured-nation provisions">
        <p>1.

        <p>2.

        <p>2. If the dispute referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article cannot be settled within three months from the date when either party to the dispute requested settlement through negotiations, the investor concerned may submit the dispute for settlement to a competent court of the Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute.</p>
        <p>3. Instead of resorting to the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, the investor concerned may choose to submit the dispute for settlement through arbitration to:</p>
        <p>- an ad hoc arbitral tribunal according to the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL);</p>

        <p>1. Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement should, if possible, be settled through the diplomatic channel.</p>
        <p>2. If a dispute between the Contracting Parties cannot thus be settled, it shall upon the request of either Contracting Party be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>3. Such an arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way. Within two months of the receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the tribunal.

The Chairman shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>4. If within the periods specified in paragraph 3 of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make any necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he too is prevented from discharging the said function, the Member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be binding on both Contracting Parties. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings; the cost of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties.
