        <p>(2) Investments made, in accordance with the laws of one Contracting Party, within its territory by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party shall enjoy the full protection of this Treaty.</p>
        <p>(3) Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use or enjoyment of investments in its territory of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3">
        <p>(1) Neither Contracting Party shall subject investments in its territory owned or controlled by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to treatment less favourable than it accords to investments of its own nationals or companies or to investments of nationals or companies of any third State.</p>
        <p>(2) Neither Contracting Party shall subject nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, as regards their activity in connection with investments in its territory, to treatment less favourable than it accords to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third State.</p>
        <p>(3) The provisions of paragraph 1 and 2 of this Article shall not apply to privileges which either Contracting Party accords to nationals or companies of third States on account of its membership of, or association with, a customs or economic union, a common market or a free trade area.</p>

        <p>(1) Investments by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>(2) Investments by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be expropriated, nationalized or subjected to any other measure the effects of which would be tantamount to expropriation or nationalization, hereinafter referred to as "comparable measure", in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for the public benefit and against compensation. Such compensation shall be equivalent to the value of the expropriated investment immediately before the date on which the actual or threatened expropriation, nationalization or comparable measure was made known by the authorities.

Provision shall have been made in an appropriate manner at or prior to the time of expropriation, nationalization or comparable measures for the determination and payment of such compensation.

        <p>(3) Nationals or companies of either Contracting Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Contracting Party owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency, or revolt, shall be accorded treatment no less favourable by such other Contracting Party than that which the latter Contracting Party accords to its own nationals or companies as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other valuable consideration. Such payments shall be freely transferable.</p>

The latter Contracting Party shall also recognize the subrogation of the former Contracting Party to any such right or claim (assigned claims) which that Contracting Party shall be entitled to assert to the same extent as its predecessor in title. As regards the transfer of payments made by virtue of such assigned claims, Article 4 (2) and (3) as well as Article 5 shall apply mutatis mutandis.</p>

        <p>(2) In case the rate of exchange is not determined by the market such rate shall not substantially differ from the cross rate obtained from those rates which would be applied by the International Monetary Fund on the date of payment for conversions of the currencies concerned into Special Drawing Rights.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8">
        <p>(1) If the legislation of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to this Treaty contain a provision, whether general or specific, entitling investments by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by this Treaty, such regulation shall to the extent that it is more favourable prevail over this Treaty.</p>
        <p>(2) Each Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation it has assumed with regard to investments in its territory by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9">

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10">
        <p>(1) Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Treaty should as far as possible be settled by the governments of the two Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>(2) If a dispute cannot be thus settled, it shall upon the request of either Contracting Party be submitted to an arbitration tribunal.</p>
        <p>(3) Such arbitration tribunal shall be constituted ad hoc as follows: each Contracting Party shall appoint one member, and these two members shall agree upon a national of a third state who on approval by the two Contracting Parties shall be appointed Chairman. Such members shall be appointed within two months, and such Chairman within three months from the date on which either Contracting Party has informed the other Contracting Party that it intends to submit the dispute to an arbitration tribunal.</p>
        <p>(4) If the periods specified in paragraph 3 above have not been observed, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other arrangement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President should make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he, too, is prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the Court next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party should make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>(5) The arbitration tribunal shall reach its decisions by a majority of votes. Such decisions shall be binding. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own member and of its representatives in the arbitration proceedings; the cost of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties.

      <div type="article" num="11">
        <p>(1) Any disputes between one Contracting Party and a national or a company of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter in the territory of the former shall if possible be settled amicably.

        <p>(2) If the dispute has not been settled to the satisfaction of both parties within a period of twelve months from its submission to a competent body for the purpose of pursuing local remedies, it shall, at the request of either party to the dispute, be submitted for arbitration. Unless the parties in dispute agree otherwise, the dispute shall be submitted for arbitration under the Convention of 18 March, 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States.</p>
        <p>(3) Nothing in this Article shall be construed as preventing the Contracting Party and the national of the other Contracting Party from agreeing to submit at any time the dispute to conciliation or arbitration under Article 28 and 36 of the Convention, respectively.</p>
        <p>(4) During arbitration proceedings or the enforcement of an award, the Contracting Party involved in the dispute shall not raise the objection that the national or company of the other Contracting Party has received compensation under an insurance contract in respect of all or part of the damage.</p>
        <p>(5) Neither Contracting Party shall give diplomatic protection or bring an international claim under Article 10 of this Treaty in respect of any dispute referred to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the Centre), unless:</p>
        <p>(a) The Secretary-General of the Centre, or a conciliation commission or an arbitral tribunal constituted by it, decides that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre; or</p>
        <p>(b) The other Contracting Party does not abide by and comply with the award rendered by an arbitral tribunal; or</p>
        <p>(c) There is a case of an assignment under a law or pursuant to a legal transaction as provided for in Article 6 of this Treaty.</p>
        <p>This does not preclude informal diplomatic exchanges for the sole purpose of facilitating a settlement of the dispute.</p>

        <p>This Treaty shall be in force irrespective of whether or not diplomatic or consular relations exist between the Contracting Parties.</p>
