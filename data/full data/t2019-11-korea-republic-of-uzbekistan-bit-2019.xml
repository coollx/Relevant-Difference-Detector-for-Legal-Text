      <p>Recognizing that the reciprocal promotion and protection of investments on the basis of this Agreement will be conducive to the flow of investment and promoting the development of mutually beneficial cooperation, the stimulation of individual business initiatives and will increase prosperity in both States, and</p>
      <p>Desiring to achieve these objectives in a manner consistent with the protection of health, safety, and the environment, and the promotion of consumer protection and internationally recognized labor rights, taking note of the need to ensure the attainment of legitimate governmental objectives to foster sustainable development;</p>

        <p>For the purposes of this Agreement:</p>
        <p>(a) "investment" means every kind of asset in the territory of one Contracting Party, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an investor of the other Contracting Party, provided that the investment has been made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the former Contracting Party, and that has the characteristics of an investment, including, though not exclusively:</p>
        <p>(i) an enterprise (being a juridical person or any other entity | constituted or organized under the applicable law of the host Contracting Party, and whether private or government-owned or controlled, and includes a corporation, trust, partnership, sole proprietorship, branch, joint venture, association or organization);</p>
        <p>(ii) shares, stock, and other forms of equity participation in an enterprise;</p>
        <p>(iii) bonds, debentures, other debt instruments and loans;</p>
        <p>(iv) turnkey, construction, management, concession, revenue- sharing, and other similar contracts;</p>
        <p>(v) intellectual property rights, including copyright, trademark, patents, industrial designs, technical processes, know-how, trade secrets and trade names, and good will;</p>

        <p>(vil) reinvested returns; and</p>
        <p>(viii) other tangible or intangible, movable or immovable property, and related property rights, such as leases, mortgages, liens, and pledges.</p>
        <p>For the purposes of this Agreement, a claim to a payment that arises solely from the commercial sale of goods and services is not an investment, unless it is a loan that has the characteristics of an investment. In order to qualify as an investment, an asset must have the characteristics of an investment, such as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk.</p>
        <p>(b) "investor" means any natural or juridical person of one Contracting Party who invests in the territory of the other Contracting Party:</p>
        <p>(i) "natural person" means a natural person having the nationality of the state of the former Contracting Party in accordance with its laws, provided, however, that a natural person who is a dual national shall be deemed to be exclusively a national of the State of his or her dominant and effective nationality; and</p>
        <p>(ii) "juridical person" means any entity, such as a company, public institution, authority, foundation, partnership, firm, establishment, organization, corporation, or association incorporated or constituted in accordance with the laws and regulations of the state of the Hora Contracting Party; </p>
        <p>(c) "territory" means:</p>
        <p>(i) in respect of the Republic of Korea, the territory, including the land area, those maritime areas, including the seabed and subsoil adjacent to the outer limit of the territorial sea, over which the Republic of Korea, in accordance with international law, sovereign rights or jurisdiction for the purpose of the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of such areas;</p>
        <p>(ii) in respect of the Republic of Uzbekistan, the territory, including the land area, internal waters and the territorial sea and air space above them, as well as any area beyond its territorial sea within which the Republic of Uzbekistan has sovereign rights of exploration and exploitations of resources of the seabed and its subsoil and superjacent water resources in accordance with international law and its laws and regulations.</p>
        <p>(d) "freely usable currency" means any currency that the International Monetary Fund determines, from time to time, to be a freely usable currency in accordance with the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund and any amendments thereto;</p>
        <p>(e) "financial service" means any service of a financial nature. Financial services include all insurance and insurance-related services, and all banking and other financial services (excluding insurance), as well as services incidental or auxiliary to a service of a financial nature;</p>
        <p>(f) "laws and regulations of the State of each Contracting Party" means laws, regulations, rules, decrees with legally binding characteristic in the territory of the State of each Contracting Party.</p>
        <div type="foot_note">(1) Whether a particular type of license, authorization, permit, or similar instrument (including a concession, to the extent that it has the nature of such an instrument) has the characteristics of an investment depends on such factors as the nature and extent of the rights that the holder has under the law of the Contracting Party. Among the licenses, authorizations, permits, and similar instruments that do not have the characteristics of an investment are those that do not create any rights protected under domestic law. For greater certainty, the foregoing is without prejudice to whether any asset associated with the license, authorization, permit, or similar instrument has the characteristics of an investment.</div>
        <div type="foot_note">(2) The term "investment" does not include an order or judgment entered in a judicial or administrative action.</div>

      <div type="annex" num="ANNEX I&#xA0;" title="Expropriation">
        <p>The Contracting Parties confirm their shared understanding that:</p>
        <p>1. An action or a series of actions by a Contracting Party cannot constitute an expropriation unless it interferes with a tangible or intangible property right in an investment.</p>
        <p>2. Article 5 (Expropriation and Compensation) addresses two situations. The first is direct expropriation, where an investment is nationalized or otherwise directly expropriated through the formal transfer of title or outright seizure.</p>
        <p>3. The second situation addressed by Article 5 (Expropriation and Compensation) is indirect expropriation, where an action or a series of actions by a Contracting Party has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.</p>
        <p>(a) The determination of whether an action or a series of actions by a Contracting Party, in a specific fact situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation, requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers all relevant factors relating to the investment, including:</p>
        <p>(i) the economic impact of the government action, although the fact that an action or a series of actions by a Contracting Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred;</p>
        <p>(ii) the extent to which the coven action interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; (8) and</p>
        <p>(iii) the character of the government action, including its objectives and context. Relevant considerations could include whether the government action imposes a special sacrifice on the particular investor or investment that exceeds what the investor or investment should be expected to endure for the public interest.</p>
        <p>(b) Except in rare circumstances, such as, for example, when an action or a series of actions is extremely severe or disproportionate in light of its purpose or effect, non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a Contracting Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health, safety, the environment, and real estate price stabilization (through, for example, measures to improve the housing conditions for low-income households), do not constitute indirect expropriation. (9)</p>
        <p>4. The concept of indirect expropriation is not intended to impugn a governmental measure adopted in the exercise of legitimate regulatory authority by a Contracting Party which is otherwise consistent with other provisions of this Agreement.</p>
        <div type="foot_note">(8) For greater certainty, whether an investor's investment-backed expectations are reasonable depends in part on the nature and extent of governmental regulation in the relevant sector. For example, an investor's expectations that regulations will not change are less likely to be reasonable in a heavily regulated sector than in a less heavily regulated sector.</div>
        <div type="foot_note">(9) For greater certainty, the list of "legitimate public welfare objectives" in subparagraph (b) is not exhaustive.</div>
      </div>
      <div type="annex" num="ANNEX II" title="Taxation and expropriation">
        <p>The determination of whether a taxation measure, in a specific fact situation, constitutes an expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers all relevant factors relating to the investment, including the factors listed in Annex I and the following considerations:</p>
        <p>(a) the imposition of taxes does not generally constitute an expropriation. The mere introduction of a new taxation measure or the imposition of a taxation measure in more than one jurisdiction in respect of an investment generally does not in and of itself constitute an expropriation;</p>
        <p>(b)a taxation measure that is consistent with internationally recognized tax policies, principles, and practices should not constitute an expropriation. In particular, a taxation measure aimed at preventing the avoidance or evasion of taxation measures generally does not constitute an expropriation;</p>
        <p>(c) a taxation measure that is applied on a non-discriminatory basis, as opposed to a taxation measure that is targeted at investors of a particular nationality or at specific taxpayers, is less likely to constitute an expropriation; and.</p>
        <p>(d) a taxation measure generally does not constitute an expropriation if it was already in force when the investment was made and information about the measure was publicly available.</p>
