      <p>For the Government of the Republic of India</p>
      <p>For the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan</p>

      <div type="annex" title="Interpretation of &quot;expropriation&quot; in article 5 (expropriation)">
        <p>1. A measure of expropriation includes, apart from direct expropriation or nationalization through formal transfer of title or outright seizure, a measure or series of measures taken intentionally by a Party to create a situation whereby the investment of an investor may be rendered substantially unproductive and incapable of yielding a return without a formal transfer of title or outright seizure.</p>
        <p>2. The determination of whether a measure or a series of measures of a Party in a specific situation, constitutes measures as outlined in paragraph 1 above requires a case by case, fact based inquiry that considers, among other factors:</p>
        <p>(i) The economic impact of the measure or a series of measures, although the fact that a measure or series of measures by a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that expropriation or nationalization, has occurred;</p>
        <p>(ii) The extent to which the measures are discriminatory either in scope or in application with respect to a Party or an investor or an enterprise;</p>
        <p>(iii) The extent to which the measures or series of measures interfere with distinct, reasonable, investment-backed expectations;</p>
        <p>(iv) The character and intent of the measures or series of measures, whether they are for bona fide public interest purposes or not and whether there is a reasonable nexus between them and the intention to expropriate.</p>
        <p>3. Except in rare circumstances, non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives including health, safety and the environment concerns do not constitute expropriation or nationalization. Such actions should be in accordance with laws and regulations of the host Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>4. Actions and awards by judicial bodies of a Party that are designed, applied or issued in public interest including those designed to address health, safety and environmental concerns do not constitute expropriation or nationalization.</p>
        <p>5. This Annexure will form an integral part of the Agreement.</p>
        <p>1   For greater certainty, Article 5 shall be interpreted in accordance with Annexure-A on the clarification of indirect expropriation.</p>
