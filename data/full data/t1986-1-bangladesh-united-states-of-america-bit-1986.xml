      <p>Associated activities include:</p>
      <p>(a) the establishment, control and maintenance of branches, agencies, offices, factories or other facilities for the conduct of business;</p>
      <p>(b) the organization of companies under applicable laws and regulations; the acquisition of companies or interests in companies or in their property; and the management, control, maintenance, use, enjoyment and expansion, and time sale, liquidation, dissolution or other disposition, of companies organized or acquired.</p>
      <p>(c) the making, performance and enforcement of contracts;</p>
      <p>(d) the acquisition (whether by purchase, lease or otherwise), ownership and disposition (whether by age, testament or otherwise), of personal property of all kinds, both tangible and intangible;</p>
      <p>(e) the leasing of real property appropriate for the conduct of business;</p>
      <p>(f) the acquisition, maintenance and protection of copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, trade names, licenses and other approvals of products and manufacturing processes, and other industrial property rights; and,</p>
      <p>(g) the borrowing of funds, the purchase and issuance of equity shares, and the purchase of foreign exchange for imports.</p>
      <p>2. The most favored nation provisions of Article II, paragraph 2, shall not apply to advantages accorded by either Party to nationals or companies of any third country by virtue of that Party's binding obligations that derive from full membership in a regional customs union or free trade area.</p>
      <p>3. The provisions of Article II, paragraph 4(b), concerning the right of nationals and companies to employ personnel of their choice, shall be subject to the provision of Article X. Furthermore, as for any laws concerning the employment of foreign nationals which require the employment of a Party's own nationals in certain positions or the employment of a certain percentage of its own nationals in positions in connection with investment made in its territory by nationals or companies of the other Part, each Party agrees to administer such laws flexibly, taking into account inter alia, the nature of the investment, the requirements of the positions in question, and the availability of qualified nationals.</p>
      <p>4. The parties recognize that restrictions on transfers abroad of sales or liquidation proceeds of an investment will adversely affect future, capital inflows, contrary to the spirit of this Treaty and the interests of the Party imposing those restrictions. Nevertheless, the Parties recognize that Bangladesh may find its foreign exchange reserves at a very low level. In these circumstances, the Government of Bangladesh may temporarily delay transfers of sales or liquidation proceeds, but only (i) in a manner not less favorable than that accorded to comparable transfers to investors of third countries, (ii) to the extent and for the time period necessary to restore its reserves to a minimally acceptable level, but in no case for a period of more than five years, during each year of which an amount of no less than 20% of the value of the proceeds shall be permitted to be transferred; and (iii) after providing the investor an opportunity to invest the sales or liquidation proceeds in a manner which willpreserve its value until transfer occurs.</p>
      <p>5. The provisions of this Treaty are not intended to apply to any claims concerning losses incurred prior to the entry into force of this Treaty by nationals or companies of either Party.</p>
