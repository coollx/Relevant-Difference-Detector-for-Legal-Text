      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion and protection of investments">
        <p>1. Either Contracting Party shall encourage and create favourable, stable and transparent conditions for investors of the other Contracting Party to invest capital in its territory and, within the framework of its laws and regulations, shall admit such investments.</p>
        <p>2. Investments of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the expansion, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory of investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="National treatment and most-favoured-nation treatment">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investments and returns of investors of the other Contracting Party treatment which in any case shall not be less favourable than that which it accords to investments and returns of its own investors or to investments and returns of investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>2. Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject investors of the other Contracting Party, as regards the expansion, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments, to treatment less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to investors of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from:</p>

        <p>2. Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the investments affected immediately before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation became public knowledge in such a way as to effect the value of the investment, whichever is the earlier. The compensation shall include interest at a normal commercial rate for current transactions from the date of expropriation until the date of payment. The compensation shall be paid in a freely convertible currency and made transferable without delay, to the country designated by the claimants concerned.</p>
        <p>3. The affected investors of either Contracting Party shall have a right, under the law of the Contracting Party making the expropriation, to prompt review, by a judicial or other independent authority of that Party, concerning the legality of the expropriation, its process and the valuation of the investment in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 1 of this Article.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Compensation for losses">
        <p>Investors of either Contracting Party who suffer losses including damages in respect of their investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency, revolt, insurrection or riot shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party treatment, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement, no less favourable than that which the latter Contracting Party accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Transfers">
        <p>1.

        <p>3. Transfers shall be done in accordance with the procedures established by the exchange regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made, which shall not imply a rejection, suspension or denaturalisation of such transfer.</p>
        <p>4. The Contracting Parties undertake to accord to such transfers a treatment no less favourable than that accorded to transfers originating from investments made by investors of any third State.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Subrogation">
        <p>1. If a Contracting Party or its designated agency makes a legal payment to any of its investors under a guarantee or a contract of insurance against non-commercial risks given in respect of an investment, the other Contracting Party shall recognise, notwithstanding its rights under the Article 10 of this Agreement, the validity of the subrogation in favour of the former Contracting Party or its agency to any right or title held by the investor.</p>
        <p>2. The Contracting Party or its agency that is subrogated in the rights of an investor shall be, in all circumstances, entitled to the same rights and the same treatment as those of the indemnified investor, payments due pursuant to those rights.</p>
        <p>3. In the case of subrogation as defined in paragraph 1 of this Article, the investor shall not sue or pursue a claim unless authorised to do so by the Contracting Party or its agency.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Settlement of disputes between an investor and a contracting party">
        <p>1. Any dispute which may arise between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party in connection with an investment on the territory of that other Contracting Party shall be settled amicably through consultations and negotiations.</p>
        <p>2. If a dispute can not be settled in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article within a period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the investor concerned may submit the dispute either to:</p>
        <p>a) The competent court or administrative tribunal of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment has been made; or</p>
        <p>b) Ad hoc arbitral tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); or</p>
        <p>c) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter referred to as "the Centre") through conciliation or arbitration established under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature in Washington D.C. on 18 March 1965 (hereinafter referred to as "the Convention"), in the event both Contracting Parties shall have become a party to the Convention.</p>
        <p>3. A company which is incorporated or constituted under the laws in force in the territory of one Contracting Party and in which before such dispute arises the majority of shares are owned by investors of the other Contracting Party, shall in accordance with Article 25 (2) (b) of the Convention be treated for the purpose of this Convention as the company of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>4. Neither Contracting Party shall pursue through the diplomatic channels any dispute referred to the Centre unless:</p>
        <p>a) The Secretary-General of the Centre, or a conciliation commission or an arbitral tribunal constituted by the Centre, decides that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre; or</p>
        <p>b) The other Contracting Party should fail to abide by or to comply with any award rendered by an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>5. The arbitration award shall be based on:</p>
        <p>- The provisions of this Agreement;</p>
        <p>- The laws of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment has been made including the rules relative to conflict of laws; and</p>
        <p>- The rules and universally accepted principles of international law.</p>
        <p>6. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on both parties to the dispute and shall be executed according to the law of the Contracting Party concerned.</p>
        <p>7. During the arbitral or execution proceedings Contracting Party shall not assert as a defence, objection, counterclaim, right of set-off or for any other reason, that indemnification or other compensation for all or part of the alleged damages has been received or will be received by investor who is contending party, pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract against political risks.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Consultations and exchange of information">
        <p>1. Upon the request by either Contracting Party, the other Contracting Party shall, without undue delay, begin consultations concerning interpretation and application of this Agreement.</p>
        <p>2. Upon the request by either Contracting Party, information shall be exchanged on the impact that the laws, regulations, decisions, administrative practices or procedures or policies of the other Contracting Party may have on investments covered by this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Settlement of disputes between contracting parties">
        <p>1. Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement should, if possible, be settled by consultations and negotiations through diplomatic channels.</p>
        <p>2. If a dispute between the Contracting Parties cannot be settled in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article within six months from the date of request for settlement, the dispute shall upon the request of either Contracting Party be submitted to an arbitral tribunal of three members.</p>
        <p>3. Such arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way. Within two months from the date of receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the tribunal. Those two members shall then select a national of a third State who on approval by the two Contracting Parties shall be appointed Chairman of the tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>4. If within the periods specified in paragraph 3 of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make any necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he too is prevented from discharging the said function, the Member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5. The tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
        <p>6. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be final and binding on both Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>7. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings; the cost of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. The tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the two Contracting Parties, and this award shall be binding on both Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>8. A dispute shall not be submitted to an international arbitral tribunal under the provisions of this Article, if the same dispute has been brought before another international arbitration court under the provisions of Article 8 and is still before the court. This will not impair the possibility of dispute settlement in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Application of other rules">
        <p>If the provisions of law of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement contain rules, whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by the present Agreement, such rules shall to the extent that they are more favourable prevail over the present Agreement as long as they last.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="12" title="Application of the agreement">

        <p>3. Either Contracting Party may, by giving one year in advance written notice to the other Contracting Party, terminate this Agreement at the end of the initial ten year period or at any time thereafter.</p>
        <p>4. With respect to investments made or acquired prior to the date of termination of this Agreement, the provisions of all other Articles of this Agreement shall continue to be effective for a further period of ten years from such date of termination.</p>
        <p>5. This Agreement may be amended by written agreement between the Contracting Parties. Any amendment shall enter into force under the same procedure required for entering into force of the present Agreement.</p>
        <p>6. This Agreement shall be applied irrespective of whether or not the Contracting Parties have diplomatic or consular relations.</p>
