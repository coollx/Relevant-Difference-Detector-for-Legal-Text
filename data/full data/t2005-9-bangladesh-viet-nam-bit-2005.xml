        <p>(1) For the purpose of solving disputes with respect to investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, consultations will take place between the parties concerned with a view to solving the case, as far as possible, amicably.</p>
        <p>(2) If these consultations do not result in a solution within six months from the date of request for settlement, the investor may submit the dispute, at his choice, for settlement to:</p>
        <p>(a) The competent court of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment has been made; or</p>

        <p>(2) If a dispute between the Contracting Parties cannot be settled through diplomatic channels, it shall, upon the request of either of the Contracting Parties, be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>(3) The arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way. Within two months of the receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the tribunal. Those two members shall then select a national of a third State who. on approval by the two Contracting Parties, shall be appointed Chairman of the tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>(4) If within the periods specified in paragraph (3) of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, either of the Contracting Parties may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make any necessary appointments.

        <p>(5) The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be binding on both the Contracting Parties. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings; the cost of the Chairman and the remaining cost shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. The tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of cost shall be borne by one of the two Contracting Parties, and this award shall be binding on both the Contracting Parties. The tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
