      <p>Agreement between the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Government of the Polish People's Republic on the Promotion and Mutual Protection of Investments</p>
    </title>
    <preamble>
      <p>The Government of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Government of the Polish People's Republic,</p>
      <p>Desiring to intensify economic cooperation to the mutual benefit of both countries and to maintain fair and equitable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting Sarty in the territory of the other Contracting Party,</p>
      <p>Recognizing that the promotion and protection of such investments favour the expansion of the economic relations between the two Contracting Parties and stimulate investment initiatives,</p>
      <p>Have agreed as follows:</p>
    </preamble>
    <body>
      <div type="article" num="1">
        <p>For the purposes of the present Agreement:</p>
        <p>(1) The term "investment" shall comprise every kind of asset, invested by investors of one Contracting Party, provided that the investment has been made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the other Contracting Party, and shall include in particular, though not exclusively:</p>
        <p>(a) Movable and immovable property as well as any other property rights, such as mortgage, lien, pledge, usufruct and similar rights;</p>
        <p>(b) Shares and other kinds of interest in companies;</p>
        <p>(c) Title to money or any performance having an economic value;</p>
        <p>(d) Patents, other industrial property rights, technical processes, trade names, know-how and other intellectual property rights as well as good-will;</p>
        <p>(e) Business concessions which are required to conduct economic activity and are conferred by law, administrative decisions or contracts; including concessions to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources;</p>
        <p>(2) The term &#x201E;investor" shall mean:</p>
        <p>(a) Any natural person who is a national of a Contracting Party in accordance with its laws; and</p>
        <p>(b) Any legal entity having a seat in the territory of the other Contracting Party, or in a third country with a predominant interest of an investor of either Contracting Party. However, purely contractual relations alone do not constitute a predominant interest. A legal entity may not invoke protection under this agreement if it had earlier invoked remedies available to it pursuant to another investment protection agreement concluded with the third country in question.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall at all times ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by unreasonable measures. As such unreasonable measures are considered restrictions on purchases of raw materials, components and units, auxiliary materials, energy and fuel as well as means of production and operation of all kinds. Hindrance on the sale of products within the country and abroad and other measures should not be instituted. The introduction of general restrictions, based on the economic situation, e.g. shortages, are not considered unreasonable.</p>
        <p>(2) In connection with the transport of goods or of personnel associated with an investment, the investor shall have the right to freely select the carrier. In cases where permission is required for such transport, this shall be granted without regard to any possible quotas. Concerning transportation through third countries, permission will be granted in accordance with applicable international law and agreements.</p>
        <p>(3) Subject to the laws and regulations relating to the entry and sojourn of aliens, nationals of one Contracting Party, together with family members of their household, shall be permitted to enter into, remain and leave the territory of the other Contracting Party for the purpose of carrying out activities associated with investments in the territory of the latter Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>(4) Each Contracting Party shall, subject to its general policy in the field of foreign investment, promote in its territory investments by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall admit such investments in accordance with its legislation.</p>
        <p>(5) In order to create favourable conditions for assessing the financial position and the results of activities which are based on investments under this agreement, the Contracting Parties shall permit, as far as is possible within the framework of their national legislation, harmonization of the investors' accounting procedures with the International Accounting Standards (IAS) drawn up by the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC).</p>
        <p>(6) An investment made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is undertaken, enjoys the full protection of the present Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall apply to investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party a treatment which is no less favourable than that accorded to investments by investors of third States.</p>
        <p>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph (1) of this Article, a Contracting Party</p>
        <p>(a) Which has concluded an agreement regarding the formation of a customs union, common market or a free-trade area, or</p>
        <p>(b) Which has concluded a multilateral agreement on economic co-operation for mutual economic assistance,</p>
        <p>Shall be free to grant more favourable treatment to investments by an investor of the State or States which are also parties to the aforesaid agreements, or by investors of some of these States.</p>
        <p>(3) The treatment granted to investments under the Commercial Agreements which the Kingdom of Sweden has concluded with the Ivory Coast on 27 August 1965, with Madagascar on 2 April 1966 and with Senegal on 24 February 1967 shall not be invoked as the basis most-favoured-nation treatment under Article 3 by Polish investors.</p>
        <p>(4) The provisions of Paragraph (1) of this Article shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to an investor of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from any international agreement or arrangement relating wholly or mainly to taxation or any domestic legislation relating wholly or mainly to taxation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4">

        <p>(b) The measures are distinct and not discriminatory; and</p>

        <p>(b) The proceeds from a total or partial liquidation of any investment by an investor of the other Contracting Party;</p>
        <p>(c) Funds in repayment of loans which both Contracting Parties have recognized as investment;</p>
        <p>(d) The earnings of nationals of the other Contracting Party who are allowed to work in connection with an investment in its territory and other amounts appropriated for the coverage of expenses connected with the management of the investment.</p>
        <p>(2) The Contracting Parties undertake to accord to transfers referred to in Paragraph (1) of this Article a treatment no less favourable than that accorded to transfers originating from investments made by investors of any third State.</p>
        <p>(3) The transfer shall be allowed without undue delay and, in any event, within a period of time not exceeding one month from the date on which the request for the transfer is made.</p>
        <p>(4) Any transfer referred to in this Agreement shall be effected at the official exchange rates prevailing on the day the transfer is made.</p>
