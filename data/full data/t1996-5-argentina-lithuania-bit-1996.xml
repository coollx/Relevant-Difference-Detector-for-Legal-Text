    </preamble>
    <body>
      <div type="article" num="1" title="Definitions">

        <p>Any alteration of the form in which assets are invested shall not affect their character as Investment, provided such an alteration is made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the host Contracting Party. </p>
        <p>This Agreement shall apply to investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, whether they were made before or after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, provided that such investments were made in accordance with the laws and regulations in force of the host Contracting Party. However, the provisions of this Agreement shall not apply to any dispute, claim or difference which arose before its entry into force. </p>
        <p>(2) The term "investor" means: </p>
        <p>a) any natural person who is a national of a Contracting Party in accordance with its laws; </p>

        <p>(3) The provisions of this Agreement shall not apply to the investments made by natural persons who are nationals of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party if such persons have, at the time of the investment, been domiciled in the latter Contracting Party for more than two years, unless it is proved that the investment was admitted into its territory from abroad. </p>
        <p>(4) The term "returns" means all amounts yielded by an investment such as profits, dividends, interests, royalties and other current income. Returns from investment and reinvestment shail enjoy the same protection as investment. </p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion of investments">

        <p>(2) Each Contracting Party, once it has admitted investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party shall grant full legal protection to such investments and shall accord them treatment which is no less favourable than that accorded to investments by its own investors or by investors of third States. </p>
        <p>(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph (2) of this Article, the treatment of the most favoured nation shall not apply to privileges which either Contracting Party accords to investors of a third State by virtue of any existing or future customs union, common market, free trade area, economic union or other forms of regional economic cooperation. </p>
        <p>(4) The provisions of Paragraph (2) of this Article shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to investors of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from an international agreement relating wholly or mainly to taxation. </p>
        <p>(5) The provisions of Paragraph (2) of this Article shall neither be construed so as to extend to investors of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from the bilateral agreements providing for concessional financing concluded by the Republic of Argentina with the Republic of Italy on 10 December 1987 and with the Kingdom of Spain on 3 June 1988. </p>

        <p>(3) The investors affected shall have a right, under the law of the Contracting Party making the expropriation, to prompt review, by the judicial or other independent authority of that Contracting Party, to determine whether such expropriation and any compensation therefore conforms to the principles of this Article. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Transfers">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall grant to investors of the other Contracting Party the unrestricted transfer of investments and returns and in particular, though not exclusively, of: </p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Subrogation">
        <p>(1) If a Contracting Party or its designated agency makes a payment to any of its investors under a guarantee or insurance it has contracted in respect of an investment, the other Contracting Party shall recognize the validity of the subrogation in favor of the former Contracting Party or its designated agency to any right or title held by the investor. The Contracting Party or its designated agency shalt, within the limits of subrogation, be entitled to exercise the same rights which the investor would have been entitled to exercise. </p>
        <p>(2) In the case of subrogation as defined in Paragraph (1) above, the investor shall not pursue a claim unless authorized to do so by the Contracting Party or its designated agency. </p>
      </div>

        <p>If the provisions of law of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement or if any agreement between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party contain rules, whether general or specific entitling investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for in the present Agreement, such rules shall, to the extent that they are more favourable, prevail over the present Agreement. </p>

      <div type="article" num="8" title="Settlement of disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>(1) Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement should, if possible, be settled through the diplomatic channel. </p>

The Chairman shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two members. </p>
        <p>(4) If within the periods specified in paragraph (3) of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make any necessary appointments.

The tribunal shall determine its own procedure. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Settlement of disputes between an investor and the host contracting party">
