      <p>Preamble</p>
      <p>The Government of the Sultanate of Oman and the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania (hereinafter referred to as the "Contracting Parties");</p>
      <p>DESIRING to intensify economic co-operation for the mutual benefit of both countries; and to create and maintain favourable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party;</p>

        <p>Any alteration of the form in which assets are invested or reinvested shall not affect their qualification as investments provided that such alteration is not in conflict with the provisions of this Agreement and the legislation of the Contracting Party on the territory of which the investment is made.</p>
        <p>(2)  &#x2018;investor" with regard to either Contracting Party, shall mean:</p>

        <p>(3)  The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall also apply to the returns from an investment as well as, in the event of liquidation, to the proceeds from the liquidation.</p>
