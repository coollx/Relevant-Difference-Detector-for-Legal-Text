          <p>(i)  are of limited duration, applied on a good-faith basis, and</p>
          <p>Should be phased out as the situation calling for imposition of such measures improves;</p>

          <p>1.  An investor of a Contracting Party may submit to arbitration under this</p>

          <p>And that the investor or a covered investment of the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.</p>
          <p>(a)  Where an investor submits a claim to arbitration under this Article,</p>
          <p>And the disputing Contracting Party invokes Article 33(3), the investor-State tribunal established pursuant to this Part may not decide whether and to what extent Article 33(3) is a valid defence to the claim of the investor. It shall seek a report in writing from the Contracting Parties on this issue. The investor-State tribunal may not proceed pending receipt of such a report or of a decision of a State-State arbitral tribunal, should such a State-State arbitral tribunal be established.</p>
          <p>(b)  Pursuant to a request for a report received in accordance with subparagraph (a), the financial services authorities of the Contracting Parties shall engage in consultations. If the financial services authorities of the Contracting Parties reach a joint decision on the issue of whether and to what extent Article 33(3) is a valid defence to the claim of the investor, they shall prepare a written report describing their joint decision. The report shall be transmitted to the investor-State tribunal, and shall be binding on the investor-State tribunal.</p>

In such a case, the provisions requiring consultations between the Contracting Parties in Article 15(1) and (2) shall not apply. The decision of the State-State arbitral tribunal shall be transmitted to the investor-State tribunal, and shall be binding on the investor-State tribunal.

          <p>(b)  be independent of, and not be affiliated with, or take instructions from, either Contracting Party or disputing party; and</p>
          <p>(c) Comply with any additional rules where such rules are agreed to by the Contracting Parties.</p>

Where the claimant claims that a dispute involves measures adopted or maintained by the disputing Contracting Party relating to financial institutions of the other Contracting Party, or investors of the other Contracting Party and covered investments of such investors in financial institutions in the disputing Contracting Party's territory, then:</p>
          <p>(a)  where the disputing parties are in agreement, the arbitrators shall, in addition to the criteria set out in paragraph 2, have expertise or experience in financial services law or practice, which may include the regulation of financial institutions; or</p>

          <p>(ii)  if the disputing Contracting Party invokes Article 33(4), the presiding arbitrator shall meet the qualifications set out in subparagraph (a).</p>
          <p>4.  If the disputing parties do not agree on the remuneration of the arbitrators before the constitution of the Tribunal, the prevailing ICSID rate for arbitrators shall apply.</p>
          <p>5.  If a Tribunal, other than a Tribunal established under Article 26, has not been constituted within 90 days from the date that a claim is submitted to arbitration, the Secretary General of ICSID, on the request of either disputing party, shall appoint, in his or her discretion, the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed, except that the presiding arbitrator shall not be a national of either Contracting Party.</p>

          <p>2.  A disputing party that seeks a consolidation order under this Article shall deliver, in writing, a request to the Secretary-General of ICSID and to all the disputing parties sought to be covered by the order and shall specify in the request: the names and addresses of all the disputing parties sought to be covered by the order; the nature of the order sought; and the grounds on which the order is sought.</p>
          <p>3.  Unless the Secretary-General of ICSID finds within 30 days after receiving a request under paragraph 2 that the request is manifestly unfounded, a tribunal shall be established under this Article.</p>
          <p>4.  Unless all the disputing parties sought to be covered by the order otherwise agree, a tribunal established under this Article shall comprise three arbitrators: one arbitrator appointed by agreement of the claimants; one arbitrator appointed by the respondent; and the presiding arbitrator appointed by the Secretary-General of ICSID, provided, however, that the presiding arbitrator shall not be a national of either Contracting Party.</p>

          <p>6.  Where a tribunal established under this Article is satisfied that two or more claims that have been submitted to arbitration under Article 20 have a question of law or fact in common, and arise out of the same events or circumstances, the tribunal may, in the interest of fair and efficient resolution of the claims, and after hearing the disputing parties, by order: assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine together, all or part of the claims; or assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine one or more of the claims, the determination of which it believes would assist in the resolution of the others.</p>
          <p>7.  A tribunal established under this Article shall conduct its proceedings in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, except as modified by this Section.</p>
          <p>8.  A tribunal established under Articles 22 through 25 shall not have jurisdiction to decide a claim, or a part of a claim, over which a tribunal established under this Article has assumed jurisdiction.</p>
          <p>9.  On application of a disputing party, a tribunal established under this Article may, pending its decision under paragraph 6, order that the proceedings of a tribunal established under Article 22 through 25 be stayed, unless the latter tribunal has already adjourned its proceedings.</p>

          <p>2.  Where, after consulting with a disputing investor, a disputing Contracting Party determines that it is in the public interest to do so and notifies the Tribunal of that determination, hearings held under this Part shall be open to the public. To the extent necessary to ensure the protection of confidential information, including business confidential information, the Tribunal may hold portions of hearings in camera.</p>
          <p>3.  A disputing party may disclose to other persons in connection with the arbitral proceedings such unredacted documents as it considers necessary for the preparation of its case, but it shall ensure that those persons protect the confidential information in such documents.</p>

The Contracting Parties may share with officials of their respective federal and sub-national governments all relevant unredacted documents in the course of dispute settlement under this Agreement, but they shall ensure that those persons protect any confidential information in such documents.</p>
          <p>5.  To the extent that a Tribunal's confidentiality order designates information as confidential and a Contracting Party's law on access to information requires public access to that information, the Contracting Party's law on access to information shall prevail. However, a Contracting Party should endeavour to apply its law on access to information so as to protect information designated confidential by the Tribunal.</p>

      <p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the duly authorized representatives of their respective Governments have signed this Agreement.</p>
      <p>DONE in duplicate at_, this_day of</p>
      <p>_2012, in the English, French and Chinese languages,</p>
      <p>All texts being equally authentic.</p>
      <p>FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA</p>
      <p>FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA</p>
      <p>Annex B.8 Exceptions</p>
      <p>1.  Canada reserves the right to adopt or maintain any measure that does not conform to the obligations in Articles 5, 6 or 7, provided that in the Schedule of Canada, including its headnote, in Annex II to the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Peru, as done at Lima on 29 May 2008, Canada reserved the right to adopt or maintain that measure in respect of investors or investments of investors of Peru. For greater certainty, this right is reserved even if the Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement is no longer in force.</p>
      <p>2.  China reserves the right to adopt or maintain any measure that does not conform to the obligations in Articles 5, 6 or 7, provided that in Chapter 10 of the Free Trade Agreement between China and the Republic of Peru, as done at Beijing on 28 April 2008, China reserved the right to adopt or maintain that measure in respect of investors or investments of investors of Peru. For greater certainty, this right is reserved even if the China-Peru Free Trade Agreement is no longer in force.</p>
      <p>Annex B.10</p>
      <p>Expropriation</p>
      <p>The Contracting Parties confirm their shared understanding that:</p>
      <p>1.  Indirect expropriation results from a measure or series of measures of a Contracting Party that has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.</p>
      <p>2.  The determination of whether a measure or series of measures of a Contracting Party constitutes an indirect expropriation requires a case-bycase, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:</p>
      <p>(a)  the economic impact of the measure or series of measures, although the sole fact that a measure or series of measures of a Contracting Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred;</p>
      <p>(b)  the extent to which the measure or series of measures interferes with distinct, reasonable, investment-backed expectations; and</p>
      <p>(c)  the character of the measure or series of measures.</p>
      <p>3.  Except in rare circumstances, such as if a measure or series of measures is so severe in light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith, a non-discriminatory measure or series of measures of a Contracting Party that is designed and applied to protect the legitimate public objectives for the well-being of citizens, such as health, safety and the environment, does not constitute indirect expropriation.</p>
      <p>Annex B.12</p>
      <p>Transfers and Exchange Formalities</p>
      <p>With regards to China:</p>
      <p>1.  The obligations in Article 12(1) shall apply provided that the transfer complies with the relevant formalities stipulated by the present laws and regulations of China relating to exchange control. These formalities:</p>
      <p>(a)  shall not be used as a means of avoiding China's commitments or obligations under this Agreement; and</p>
      <p>(b)  shall not be made more restrictive than the formalities required at the time when original investment was made.</p>
      <p>2.  With respect to these formalities, China shall accord to investors of Canada or covered investments of Canadian investors treatment no less favourable than the treatment that China accords to third country investors or investments of such investors. To the extent that these formalities are no longer required according to the relevant laws of China, Article 12(1) shall apply without restrictions.</p>
      <p>3.  A transfer shall be deemed to have been made 'without delay' within the meaning of Article 12(1) if effected within such period as is normally required for the completion of transfer formalities. The said period shall commence on the day on which the relevant request has been submitted to the relevant foreign exchange administration with full and authentic documentation and information and may not exceed two months.</p>
      <p>Annex C.21</p>
      <p>Conditions Precedent to Submission of a Claim to Arbitration: Party-Specific Requirements</p>

      <p>1.  Upon receipt of the Notice of Intent or at any time prior, China shall require that an investor make use of the domestic administrative reconsideration procedure.

      <p>2.  An investor who has initiated proceedings before any court of China with respect to the measure of China alleged to be a breach of an obligation under Part B may only submit a claim to arbitration under Article 20 if the investor has withdrawn the case from the national court before judgment has been made on the dispute. This requirement does not apply to the domestic administrative reconsideration procedure referred to in paragraph 1.</p>
      <p>Where the claim concerns a measure of Canada:</p>
      <p>3.  The investor and, where the claim is for loss or damage to an interest in an enterprise of Canada that is a juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly, the enterprise shall waive their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Contracting Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of Canada that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 20, except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages, before an administrative tribunal or court under the law of Canada.</p>
      <p>4.  The waiver required under paragraph 3 shall be delivered to Canada and shall be included in the submission of a claim to arbitration. A waiver from the enterprise shall not be required if Canada has deprived a disputing investor of control of an enterprise.</p>
