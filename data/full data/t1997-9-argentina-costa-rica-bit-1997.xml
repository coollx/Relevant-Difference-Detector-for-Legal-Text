        <div type="article" num="Ad Article 5">
          <p>1. For the purposes of Article 5(1), the Contracting Parties agree that in the case of Costa Rica "market value" shall mean the concept of a fair price which shall be equivalent to the amount of compensation to be determined as follows:</p>
          <p>The opinion shall include all the information necessary for identifying the goods being valued.</p>
          <p>In the case of buildings, the opinion shall contain the valuation regardless of the field crops, buildings, inquilinatos, leases, commercial rights, the right to exploitation and any other property rights or capable of compensation.</p>
          <p>In the case of movable property, each will be assessed separately and shall specify the characteristics that affect their valuation.</p>
          <p>The valuation shall take into account only the actual damages. nor shall not be taken into account future developments and expectations of the law affecting good. nor shall be recognized capital gains arising from the project which generates expropriation.</p>
          <p>Any expert opinion shall indicate in a comprehensive and detailed elements underlying the value assigned to it and the methodology used.</p>
          <p>2. The Contracting Parties agree that any dispute regarding distribution or administration of export quotas in the domestic market, arising from the application of quantitative restrictions by a contracting party or a third State is a matter of a commercial nature. accordingly, it shall be resolved by trade rules applicable between the contracting parties.</p>

        </div>
        <div type="article" num="Ad Article 7">
          <p>Nothing in subparagraph (f) of Article 7 shall be construed as to oblige either Contracting Party to authorize the professional practice, which shall be subject to the laws of each Contracting Party.</p>
