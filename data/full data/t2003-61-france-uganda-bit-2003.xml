    </title>
    <preamble>

      <p>Desiring to strengthen the economic cooperation between both States and to create favorable conditions for French investments in (...) and (...) investments in France,</p>

    </preamble>
    <body>
      <div type="article" num="1" title="Definitions">
        <p>For the purpose of this Agreement:</p>
        <p>1. The term "investment" means every kind of assets, such as goods, rights and interests of whatever nature, and in particular though not exclusively:</p>
        <p>a) Tangible, intangible, movable and immovable property as well as any other right in rem such as mortgages, liens, usufructs, pledges and similar rights;</p>
        <p>b) Shares, premium on share and other kinds of interest including minority or indirect forms, in companies constituted in the territory of one Contracting Party;</p>
        <p>c) Title to money or debentures, or title to any legitimate performance having an economic value;</p>

        <p>It is understood that those investments are investments which have already been made or may be made subsequent to the entering into force of this Agreement, in accordance with the legislation of the Contracting Party on the territory or in the maritime area of which the investment is made.</p>
        <p>Any alteration of the form in which assets are invested shall not affect their qualification as investments provided that such alteration is not in conflict with the legislation of the Contracting Party on the territory or in the maritime area of which the investment is made.</p>
        <p>2. The term "nationals" means physical persons possessing the nationality of either Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>3. The term "company" means any legal person constituted on the territory of one Contracting Party in accordance with the legislation of that Party and having its head office on the territory of that Party, or controlled directly or indirectly by the nationals of one Contracting Party or by legal persons having their head office in the territory of one contracting Party and constituted in accordance with the legislation of that Party.</p>
        <p>4. The term "returns" means all amounts produced by an investment, such as profits, royalties and interest, during a given period.</p>
        <p>Investment returns and, in case of re-investment, re-investment returns shall enjoy the same protection as the investment.</p>

This Agreement shall apply to the territory of each Contracting Party, as well as the maritime area of each Contracting Party, hereafter defined as the economic zone and the continental shelf outwards the territorial sea of each Contracting Party over which they have in accordance with International Law sovereign rights and a jurisdiction with a view to prospecting, exploiting and preserving natural resources.</p>
        <p>6. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to prevent any contracting party from taking any measure to regulate investment of foreign companies and the conditions of activities of these companies in the framework of policies designed to preserve and promote cultural and linguistic diversity.</p>
        <p>7. For the purpose of this Agreement, it is understood that the Contracting Parties are responsible for the actions or omission of their sub-sovereign entities, including though not exclusively their federal states, regions, local governments or any other entity over which the Contracting Party exercise the control, the representation or the responsibility of its international affairs, or its sovereignty.</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Fair and equitable treatment">
        <p>Either Contracting Party shall extend fair and equitable treatment in accordance with the principles of International Law to investments made by nationals and companies of the other Contracting Party on its territory or in its maritime area, and shall ensure that the exercise of the right thus recognized shall not be hindered by law or in practice.

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="National treatment and most favored nation treatment">
        <p>Each Contracting Party shall apply on its territory and in its maritime area to the nationals and companies of the other Party, with respect to their investments and activities related to the investments, a treatment not less favorable than that granted to its nationals or companies, or the treatment granted to the nationals or companies of the most favored nation, if the latter is more favorable. In this respect, nationals authorized to work on the territory and in the maritime area of one Contracting Party shall enjoy the material facilities relevant to the exercise of their professional activities.</p>

        <p>The transfers referred to in the foregoing paragraphs shall be promptly effected at the official exchange rate prevailing on the date of transfer.</p>
        <p>In case of a serious balance of payments difficulties and external financial difficulties or the threat thereof, each contracting party may temporarily restrict transfers, provided that this restriction: i) shall be promptly notified to the other party; ii) shall be consistent with the articles of agreement with the International Monetary Fund; iii) shall not exceed in any case six months; iv) would be imposed in an equitable, non discriminatory and in good faith basis</p>
      </div>

        <p>2. Investments made by nationals or companies of one Contracting Party on the territory or in the maritime area of the other Contracting Party may obtain the guarantee referred to in the foregoing paragraph only if they have been previously agreed to by the other Party.</p>
        <p>3.
