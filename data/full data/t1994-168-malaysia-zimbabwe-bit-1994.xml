        <p>Arise, the Contracting Party and the investor concerned shall seek to resolve the dispute through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot thus be resolved within six (6) months, then if the investor concerned also consents in writing to submit the dispute to the Centre for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Convention, either party to the dispute may institute proceedings</p>
        <p>By addressing a request to that effect to the Secretary-General of the Centre as set forth in Articles 28 and 36 of the Convention, provided that the dispute is not currently pending before the courts of justice or administrative tribunals or agencies of competent jurisdiction of the Contracting Party that is party to the dispute.</p>
