      <p>CONVENTION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA ON THE PROTECTION OF INVESTMENTS</p>
    </title>
    <preamble>
      <p>The Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Republic of Tunisia, in order to promote the development of investment franc&#xE7;is in Tunisia, have agreed as follows:</p>
    </preamble>
    <body>
      <div type="article" num="1">
        <p>The French Government may, after examining each case and in&nbsp;accordance with its regulations, issue the guarantee of the French State to&nbsp;investments made in the territory of the Republic of Tunisia by French&nbsp;nationals, whether individuals or bodies corporate, under the conditions set forth&nbsp;in article 2 below.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2">
        <p>Such investments shall have been approved by the Tunisian&nbsp;Government, which shall enter into a specific undertaking in respect of them&nbsp;with the said French nationals covering, inter alia, recourse to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) if, in the event of a dispute,&nbsp;an amicable settlement has not been reached within three months.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3">
        <p>If the French State, by virtue of a guarantee issued in respect of&nbsp;an investment in the territory of the Republic of Tunisia, makes payments&nbsp;to its own nationals, whether individuals or bodies corporate, it shall thereby&nbsp;automatically succeed to the rights of such nationals with respect to the Tunisian&nbsp;Government.</p>
        <p>Such payments shall not affect the rights of the beneficiary of the guarantee&nbsp;to have recourse to ICSID or to continue actions brought before it until the&nbsp;outcome of the proceedings has been determined.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4">
        <p>This Convention is concluded for a period of ten years, renewable for the same period, unless it is terminated in writing by one of the two&nbsp;Contracting Parties one year before the expiry of each period.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the event of termination, the provisions of this Convention shall continue&nbsp;to be applicable to the investments covered by its provisions and made during the&nbsp;period of its validity</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5">
        <p>This Convention shall enter into force on the date of its signature.</p>
      </div>
    </body>
    <conclusion>
      <p>Done at Paris on 30 June 1972, in two original copies in the French language, both texts being equally authentic.</p>
