        <p>3.  An investment dispute shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably through consultation or negotiation between the disputing parties.</p>
        <p>4.  If an investment dispute cannot be settled through such consultation or negotiation within three months from the date on which the disputing investor requested for consultation or negotiation in writing and if the disputing investor has not submitted the investment dispute for resolution under courts of justice or administrative tribunals or agencies, the disputing investor may submit the investment dispute to one of the following international conciliations or arbitrations:</p>
        <p>(a)  conciliation or arbitration in accordance with the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965 (hereinafter referred to in this Article as "ICSID Convention"), so long as the ICSID Convention is in force between the Contracting Parties;</p>

        <p>5.  The applicable arbitration rules shall govern the arbitration set forth in paragraph 4 above except to the extent modified in this Article.</p>
        <p>6.  The disputing investor who intends to submit the investment dispute to conciliation or arbitration pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article shall give to the disputing Party written notice of intent to do so at least ninety days before the claim is submitted. The notice of intent shall specify:</p>
        <p>(a)  the name and address of the disputing investor;</p>

Notwithstanding paragraph 7 of this Article, no claim may be submitted to conciliation or arbitration set forth in paragraph 4 of this Article, if more than three years have elapsed since the date on which the disputing investor acquired or should have first acquired, whichever is the earlier, the knowledge that the disputing investor had incurred loss or damage referred to in paragraph 1(a) of this Article.</p>
        <p>10.  Notwithstanding paragraph 4 of this Article, the disputing investor may initiate or continue an action that seeks interim injunctive relief that does not involve the payment of damages before an administrative tribunal or agency or a court of justice under the applicable law of the disputing Party.</p>
        <p>11.  Unless the disputing parties agree otherwise, an arbitral tribunal established under paragraph 4 of this Article shall comprise three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each of the disputing parties and the third, who shall be the presiding arbitrator, appointed by agreement of the disputing parties. If the disputing investor or the disputing Party fails to appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators within sixty days from the date on which the investment dispute was submitted to arbitration, the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter referred to in this Article as "ICSID") may be requested by either of the disputing parties to appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed from the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators subject to the requirements of paragraphs 12 and 13 of this Article.</p>
        <p>12.  Unless the disputing parties agree otherwise, the third arbitrator shall not be a national of either Contracting Party, nor have his or her usual place of residence in the territory of either Contracting Party, nor be employed by either of the disputing parties, nor have dealt with the investment dispute in any capacity.</p>
        <p>13.  In the case of arbitration referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article, each of the disputing parties may indicate up to three nationalities, the appointment of arbitrators of which is unacceptable to it. In this event, the Secretary-General of the ICSID may be requested not to appoint as arbitrator any person whose nationality is indicated by either of the disputing parties.</p>
        <p>14.  Unless the disputing parties agree otherwise, the arbitration shall be held in a State that is a party to the New York Convention.</p>
        <p>15.  An arbitral tribunal established under paragraph 4 of this Article shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law.</p>
        <p>16.  The disputing Party shall deliver to the other Contracting Party:</p>
        <p>(a)  written notice of the claim submitted to the arbitration no later than thirty days after the date on which the claim was submitted; and</p>
        <p>(b)  copies of all pleadings filed in the arbitration.</p>
        <p>17.  The Contracting Party which is not the disputing Party may make submissions to the arbitral tribunal on a question of interpretation of this Agreement, upon written notice to the disputing parties.</p>
        <p>18.  The arbitral tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of the disputing investor, or to facilitate the conduct of arbitral proceedings, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of either of the disputing parties. The arbitral tribunal shall not order attachment or enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in paragraph 1(a) of this Article.</p>
        <p>19.  The award rendered by the arbitral tribunal shall include:</p>
        <p>(a)  a judgement whether or not there has been a breach by the disputing Party of any obligation under this Agreement with respect to the disputing investor and its investments; and</p>

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed so as to oblige either Contracting Party to extend to investors of the other Contracting Party and their investments treatment accorded to investors of a non-Contracting Party and their investments by virtue of multilateral agreements in respect of protection of intellectual property rights, to which the former Contracting Party is a party.</p>
        <p>3.

        <p>(b)  The investor shall refer the issue, at the time that it delivers the notice of intent under paragraph 6 of Article 17 of this Agreement, to the competent authorities of both Contracting Parties to determine whether such measure is not an expropriation.

        <p>The Contracting Parties recognise that it is inappropriate for a Contracting Party to encourage investment by investors of the other Contracting Party and of a non-Contracting Party by relaxing its health, safety or environmental measures or by lowering its labour standards.

        <p>2.  Subject to prior notification and consultation, a Contracting Party may deny the benefits of this Agreement to an investor of the other Contracting Party that is an enterprise of the other Contracting Party and to its investments if the enterprise is owned or controlled by an investor of a non-Contracting Party and the enterprise has no substantial business activities in the Area of the other Contracting Party.</p>
