      <p>And</p>

        <p>f) Any increases in value of the original investment.</p>
        <p>Any change in the form of an investment, admitted in accordance with laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made, does not effect its character of such investment.</p>
        <p>2. The term "investor" shall be construed to mean any natural or legal person of a Contracting Party investing in the territory of the other Contracting Party as well as the foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and branches controlled in any way by the above natural and legal persons.</p>

        <p>9. "Right of access" means the right to be admitted to carry out investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion and protection of investments">
        <p>1. Both Contracting Parties shall encourage investors of the other Contracting Party to invest in their territory and admit such investments in accordance with its laws and regulations.</p>
        <p>2. Investors of one of the Contracting Parties shall have the right of access to the investment activities, in the territory of the other Contracting Party, not less favourable than the one granted as per Article 3.1.</p>

Both Contracting Parties shall ensure that the management, maintenance, use, transformation, enjoyment or assignment of the investments affected in their territory by investors of the other Contracting Party, as well as companies and enterprises in which these investments have been effected, shall in no way be subject to unjustified or discriminatory measures.</p>
        <p>4. Each Contracting Party shall create and maintain, in its territory a legal framework apt to guarantee to investors the continuity of legal treatment, including the compliance, in good faith, of all undertakings assumed with regard to each specific investor.</p>

        <p>1.

In case, from the legislation of one of the Contracting Parties, or from the international obligations in force or that may come into force for the future for one of the Contracting Parties, should come out a legal framework according to which the investors of the other Contracting Party would be granted a more favourable treatment than the one foreseen in this Agreement, the treatment granted to the investors of such other Parties will apply also for outstanding relationships.</p>
        <p>3. The provisions under paragraph 1 and 2 of this Article do not refer to the advantages and privileges which one Contracting Party may grant to investors of third States by virtue of their membership of a Customs or Economic Union, of a Common Market, of a Free Trade Area, of a regional or sub-regional Agreement, of an international multilateral economic Agreement or under Agreements signed in order to prevent double taxation or to facilitate cross border trade.</p>

Compensation payments shall be freely transferable without undue delay.</p>
        <p>The investors concerned shall receive the same treatment as the nationals of the other Contracting Party and, at all events, no less favourable than that of investors of Third States.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Nationalization or expropriation">
        <p>1. The investments to which this Agreement relates shall not be subject to any measure which might limit the right of ownership, possession, control or enjoyment of the investments, permanently or temporarily, save where specifically provided by current, national or local, legislation and/or regulations and orders handed down by Courts or Tribunals having jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>2. Investments of investors of one of the Contracting Parties shall not be, "de iure" or "de facto", directly or indirectly, totally or partially, nationalized, expropriated, requisitioned or subjected to any measures having an equivalent effect in the territory of the other Contracting Party, except for public purposes or national interest and in exchange for immediate, full and effective compensation, and on condition that these measures are taken on a non-discriminatory basis and in conformity with all legal provisions and procedures.</p>
        <p>3. The just compensation shall be established on the basis of the market value immediately prior to the moment in which the decision to nationalise or expropriate is announced or made public.</p>
        <p>In the absence of an understanding between the host Contracting Party and the investor during the nationalisation, or expropriation procedure, compensation shall be based on the same reference parameters and exchange rates taken into account in the documents for the constitution of the investment.</p>
        <p>The exchange rate applicable to any such compensation shall be that prevailing on the date immediately prior to the moment in which the nationalization or expropriation has been announced or made public.</p>
        <p>4. Without restricting the scope of the above paragraph, in case that the object of nationalisation, expropriation, or similar, is a company with foreign capital, the evaluation of the share of the investor will be in the currency of the investment not lower than the starting value, increased by capital increases and revaluation of capital, in distributed profits and reserve funds, and diminished by the value of capital reductions and losses.</p>
        <p>5. Compensation will be considered as actual if it will be paid in the same currency in which the investment has been made by the foreign investor, in as much as such currency is &#x2014; or remains &#x2014; convertible, or, otherwise, in any other currency accepted by the investor.</p>
        <p>6. Compensation payment will be considered as timely if it takes place without undue delay and, in any case, within three months from the day on which the relevant request has been submitted.</p>
        <p>7. Compensation shall include interests calculated on a six months LIBOR basis from the date of nationalisation or expropriation to the date of payment and will be freely transferable.</p>
        <p>8. The investor affected shall have a right, under the law of the Contracting Party making the expropriation, to prompt review by a judicial or other competent authority of that Contracting Party, of his or its case to determine whether such expropriation and any compensation, therefore, conforms to the principles set out in this Article.</p>
        <p>9. The provisions of paragraph 2. of this Article shall also apply to profits accruing to an investment and, in the event of winding-up, the proceeds of liquidation.</p>
        <p>10. If, after the dispossession, the good concerned has not been utilized, wholly or partially, for that purpose, the owner or his assignees are entitled to the repurchasing of the good at the market price.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Repatriation of capital, profits and income">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party in whose territory investments have been made by investors of the other Contracting Party shall grant those investors a free transfer of the payments relating to these investments, particularly but not exclusively, of:</p>
        <p>a) Capital and additional capital, including reinvested income, used to maintain and increase investment;</p>
        <p>b) Net income, dividends, royalties, payments for assistance and technical services, interests and other profits;</p>
        <p>c) Income deriving from the total or partial sale or the total or partial liquidation of an investment;</p>
        <p>d) Funds to repay loans connected to an investment and payment of the related interests;</p>
        <p>e) Remuneration and allowances paid to nationals of the other Contracting Party for work and services performed in relation to an investment effected in the territory of the other Contracting Party, in the amount and manner prescribed by the national legislation and regulations in force.</p>
        <p>2. Without restricting the scope of Article 3 of this Agreement, the Contracting Parties undertake to accord to transfers referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article a treatment no less favourable than that accorded to transfers originating from investments made by investors of any third State.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Subrogation">
        <p>In the event that one Contracting Party or an institution thereof has provided a guarantee in respect of non-commercial risks for investment effected by one of its investors in the territory of the other Contracting Party, and has effected payment to the said investor on the basis of that guarantee, the other Contracting Party shall recognise the assignment of the rights of the investor to the first-named Contracting Party.

        <p>2. The fiscal obligations under the previous paragraph are deemed to be complied with when the investor has fulfilled the obligations according to the proceedings provided for by the law of the Contracting Party on the territory of which the investment has been carried out.</p>
