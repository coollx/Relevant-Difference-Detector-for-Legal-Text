The term "returns" shall mean the amounts yielded by investments, over a given period, in particular, though not exclusively, shall include profits, dividends, interests, royalties or other forms of income related to the investments including technical assistance fees.</p>
        <p>In cases where the returns of investment, as defined above, are reinvested, the income resulting from the reinvestment shall also be considered as income related to the first investments. 3. The term "investor" means:</p>

        <p>1.

        <p>2. Investors of one Contracting Party shall be accorded by the other Contracting Party, as regards the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal or their investments, treatment which is fair and equitable and not less favourable that the latter Contracting Party accords its own investors or to investors of any third State.</p>

        <p>2. Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the investment affected immediately before the actual measure was taken or became public knowledge, whichever is earlier, it shall be paid without delay, shall include interest from the date of expropriation until the date of payment at a normal commercial rate and shall be freely transferable in a freely convertible currency.</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If either Contracting Party or its designated agency makes any payment to one of its investors as a result of a guarantee in respect of an investment made in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the former Contracting Party shall be subrogated to the rights and shares of this investor, and may exercise them according to the same terms and conditions as the original holder.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Disputes between the Contracting Parties">
        <p>1. Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation and application to this Agreement should, as far as possible, be settled by negotiations through diplomatic channels.</p>

        <p>3. The Arbitral Tribunal shall be constituted ad hoc, as follows: Each of the Contracting Parties shall appoint one member and these two members shall propose a national of a third State as chairman to be appointed by the two Contracting Parties.

        <p>4. If the deadlines specified in paragraph 3 of this Article are not complied with, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President is prevented from doing so, or is a national of either Contracting Party, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>If the Vice-President is also a national of either Contracting Party or if he is prevented from making the appointments for any other reason, the appointments shall be made by the member of the Court who is next in seniority and who is not a national of either Contracting Party. 5.
