        <p>Embassy of the Republic of Argentina</p>
        <p>Mr. Minister:</p>
        <p>On the occasion of the signing of the Treaty on the Promotion and Protection of Reciprocal Investments on 9 April 1991, the Government of the Argentine Republic has the honour to inform the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany of the following:</p>
        <p>On the basis of the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation of 1988 or the Treaty for the Establishment of a Special Partnership Relationship of 1987 respectively, the Kingdom of Spain and the Italian Republic grant the Argentine Republic concessional credit lines with the aim of financing investments for the implementation of investments, especially for the creation of joint ventures in the small and medium sized enterprise sector.</p>
        <p>Financing requests for each project must be authorized in accordance with special Argentinean regulations and subsequently agreed upon with the Spanish or Italian counterpart, as the case may be.</p>
        <p>In return, the Argentine Republic has committed itself to:</p>
        <p>- grant tariff and tax exemption for imports of goods intended for investment financed by the concessionary credits provided for in the respective treaties.</p>
        <p>- not to adopt any measures which would prevent the repatriation of the invested capital or the free transfer of profits from risk investments for those projects which have been financed according to the provisions of the above-mentioned Treaties.</p>
        <p>These special conditions are granted with the aim of enabling new investments for the economic development of Argentina in areas whose promotion is particularly necessary.</p>
        <p>The Contracting Parties interpret Article 3 of the Treaty on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments in such a way that the most-favoured-nation clause does not refer to the special conditions and privileges which the Argentine Republic grants to foreign investors for the above-mentioned projects.</p>
        <p>The Argentine Republic will ensure that German investors and their investments, which are not subject to the special conditions mentioned above, will not be substantially affected in their competitive capacity.</p>
        <p>Please accept, Mr. Minister, the assurances of my highest and most distinguished consideration.</p>

        <p>"On the occasion of the Treaty on the reciprocal promotion and protection of investments signed between our two countries on 9 April 1991, I have the honour to inform you of the following:</p>
        <p>As from the entry into force of the said Treaty and taking into account the principle established in its Article 5 on the free transfer of capital and profits, the German authorities have the possibility, after the submission by interested investors of an application to guarantee an investment in Argentina, to grant full coverage of such investments in accordance with the directives and general conditions in force. Therefore, as from the entry into force of this Treaty, these authorities may, in addition to those currently available, grant guarantees in respect of the amounts obtained from an investment during a given period, such as profit shares, dividends and interest.</p>
        <p>Allow me, Mr. Minister, to convey to you the assurances of my highest consideration".</p>
