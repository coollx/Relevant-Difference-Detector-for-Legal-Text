      <p>AGREEMENT ON THE INTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN ARTICLES OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA AND THE REPUBLIC OF PARAGUAY ON THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF INVESTMENT SIGNED ON 13 AUGUST 1993</p>
      <p>Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores</p>
      <p>N.R. No. 5/97</p>
      <p>Asuncion, 4 July 1997</p>
      <p>Madam Secretary of State!</p>
      <p>I have the honour of addressing Your Excellency to propose some definitions in the context of the Agreement signed by the Republic of Paraguay and the Republic of Austria on 13 August 1993 on the Promotion and Protection of Investments in accordance with the Constitution of our country, as follows:</p>
      <p>With reference to Article 4(1), which states that the term "public purpose" shall include "social interest"; with reference to Article 8(4), it is emphasized that the purpose of this provision is not to provide compensation twice to the aggrieved investor. It is only a matter of ensuring that compensation is paid by the expropriating State even if the injured firm is compensated by its risk insurance. The aggrieved firm would then, if necessary, have to cede the payments made by the expropriating State to the risk insurance. This interpretation is fully consistent with the text of Article 6 of the Convention concerning subrogation; and with reference to Article 10: the provision of this Article is expressly intended to&nbsp;cover, without distinction, both investments made before and after the entry into force. On the other hand, the Agreement will not apply to disputes concerning an investment which arose and were brought before the entry into force. If the Austrian Government were to agree to the above declarations, this letter and Your Excellency's reply would constitute an agreement on the interpretation of certain articles of the Agreement between the Republic of Paraguay and the Republic of Austria on the Promotion and Protection of Investments signed on 13 August 1993, which forms an integral part of that Agreement. This Agreement is subject to ratification and will enter into force on the first day of the third month following the month in which the instruments of ratification have been exchanged.</p>
      <p>I take this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration.</p>
