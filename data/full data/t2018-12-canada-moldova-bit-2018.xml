          <p>2.  A measure that requires an investment to use a technology to meet generally applicable health, safety, or environmental requirements is not inconsistent with subparagraph 1(f).</p>

          <p>1.  A Party may not nationalize or expropriate a covered investment either directly or indirectly through measures having an effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation ("expropriation"), except for a public purpose, in accordance with due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner and on payment of compensation in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3. For greater certainty, this paragraph shall be interpreted in accordance with Annex B.10.</p>
          <p>2.  The compensation referred to in paragraph 1 must be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation took place ("date of expropriation"), and must not reflect any change in value occurring because the intended expropriation had become known earlier. Valuation criteria shall include going concern value, asset value including declared tax value of tangible property, and other criteria, as appropriate, to determine fair market value.</p>
          <p>3.  Compensation shall be paid without delay and shall be fully realizable and freely transferable. Compensation shall be payable in a freely convertible currency and shall include interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that currency accrued from the date of expropriation until the date of payment.</p>
          <p>4.  The affected investor shall have a right under the law of the expropriating Party to prompt review of its case and of the valuation of its investment by a judicial or other independent authority of that Party in accordance with the principles set out in this Article.</p>
          <p>5.  This Article shall not apply to the issuance of compulsory licenses granted in relation to intellectual property rights, or to the revocation, limitation or creation of intellectual property rights, to the extent that such issuance, revocation, limitation or creation is consistent with the WTO Agreement.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="11" title="Transfers">
          <p>1.  Each Party shall permit all transfers relating to covered investments to be made freely, and without delay, into and out of its territory. Such transfers include:</p>
          <p>(a)  contributions to capital;</p>
          <p>(b)  profits, dividends, interest, capital gains, royalty payments, management fees, technical assistance and other fees, returns in kind and other amounts derived from the covered investment;</p>
          <p>(c)  proceeds from the sale of all or part of the covered investment or from the partial or complete liquidation of the covered investment;</p>
          <p>(d)  payments made under a contract entered into by the investor, or the covered investment, including payments made pursuant to a loan agreement;</p>
          <p>(e)  payments made under Articles 7 (Compensation for Losses) and 10 (Expropriation); and</p>
          <p>(f)  payments arising under Section C (Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and the Host Party).</p>
          <p>2.  Each Party shall permit transfers relating to covered investments to be made in the convertible currency in which the capital was originally invested, or in any other convertible currency agreed to by the investor and the Party concerned. Unless otherwise agreed by the investor, transfers shall be made at the market rate of exchange applicable on the date of transfer.</p>
          <p>3.  Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, a Party may prevent a transfer through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of its laws relating to:</p>
          <p>(a)  bankruptcy, insolvency or the protection of the rights of a creditor;</p>
          <p>(b)  issuing, trading or dealing in securities;</p>
          <p>(c)  a criminal or penal offence;</p>
          <p>(d)  financial reporting or record keeping of transfers when necessary to assist law enforcement or financial regulatory authorities; or</p>
          <p>(e)  ensuring the satisfaction of judgments in adjudicatory proceedings.</p>
          <p>4.  A Party may not require one of its investors to transfer, or penalize its investors for failing to transfer, the income, earnings, profits or other amounts derived from, or attributable to, an investment in the territory of the other Party.</p>
          <p>5.  Paragraph 4 does not prevent a Party from imposing a measure through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of its domestic laws relating to the matters in subparagraphs 3(a) through 3(e).</p>
          <p>6.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 4, and without limiting the applicability of paragraph 5, a Party may prevent or limit transfers by a financial institution to, or for the benefit of, an affiliate of or person related to such institution, through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of measures relating to maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or financial responsibility of financial institutions.</p>
          <p>7.  Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a Party may restrict transfers of returns in kind in circumstances where it could otherwise restrict transfers under the WTO Agreement and as set out in paragraph 3.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="12" title="Transparency">
          <p>1.

          <p>2.  To the extent possible, each Party shall:</p>
          <p>(a)  publish in advance any such measure that it proposes to adopt; and</p>
          <p>(b)  provide interested persons and the other Party a reasonable opportunity to comment on such proposed measures.</p>
          <p>3.  Upon request by a Party, information shall be exchanged on the measures of the other Party that may have an impact on a covered investment.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="13" title="Subrogation">
          <p>1.  If a Party or any agency thereof makes a payment to any of its investors under a guarantee or a contract of insurance it has entered into in respect of an investment, the other Party shall recognize the validity of the subrogation in favour of the Party or agency to any right or title held by the investor.</p>
          <p>2.  A Party or any agency thereof, which is subrogated to the rights of an investor in accordance with paragraph 1, shall be entitled in all circumstances to the same rights as those of the investor regarding the investment. Those rights may be exercised by the Party or an agency thereof, or by the investor if the Party or its agency so authorizes.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="14" title="Taxation measures">
          <p>1. Except as set out in this Article, this Agreement does not apply to a taxation measure.</p>
          <p>2. This Agreement does not affect the rights and obligations of a Party under a tax convention. In the event of inconsistency between this Agreement and a tax convention, that convention prevails.</p>
          <p>3. This Agreement does not require a Party to furnish or allow access to information, which if disclosed, would be contrary to the Party's law protecting information concerning the taxation affairs of a taxpayer.</p>
          <p>4. Subject to paragraph 2, Articles 4 (National Treatment) and 5 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) apply to all taxation measures, other than those on income, capital gains or on the taxable capital of corporations, except that nothing in those Articles shall apply to:</p>
          <p>(a) A non-conforming provision of an existing taxation measure;</p>
          <p>(b) The continuation or prompt renewal of a non-conforming provision of an existing taxation measure;</p>
          <p>(c) An amendment to a non-conforming provision of an existing taxation measure to the extent that the amendment does not decrease its conformity with those Articles at the time when the amendment is introduced; or</p>
          <p>(d) A new taxation measure that is aimed at ensuring the equitable and effective imposition or collection of taxes (including, for greater certainty, a measure that is taken by a Party to ensure compliance with the Party's taxation system or to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes) and that does not arbitrarily discriminate between persons, goods or services of the Parties.</p>
          <p>5. Provided that the conditions in paragraph 6 are met:</p>
          <p>(a) A claim by an investor that a taxation measure of a Party is in breach of an agreement between a national government authority of that Party and the investor concerning an investment shall be considered a claim for breach of this Agreement; and</p>
          <p>(b) The provisions of Article 10 (Expropriation) apply to taxation measures.</p>
          <p>6. An investor may not make a claim under paragraph 5 unless:</p>
          <p>(a) The investor provides a copy of the notice of claim to the taxation authorities of the Parties; and</p>

          <p>7. If, in connection with a claim by an investor of a Party or a dispute between the Parties, an issue arises as to whether a measure of a Party is a taxation measure, a Party may refer the issue to the taxation authorities of the Parties. A decision of the taxation authorities shall bind a Tribunal formed pursuant to Section C (Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and the Host Party) or an arbitral panel formed pursuant to Section D (State-to-State Dispute Settlement Procedures). A Tribunal or arbitral panel seized of a claim or a dispute in which the issue arises may not proceed until it receives the decision of the taxation authorities. If the taxation authorities have not decided the issue within six months of the referral, the Tribunal or arbitral panel shall decide the issue.</p>
          <p>8. Each Party shall notify the other Party by diplomatic note of the identity of the taxation authorities referred to in this Article.</p>

If a Party considers that the other Party has offered such an encouragement, it may request consultations with the other Party and the two Parties shall consult with a view to avoiding the encouragement.</p>

If the disputing parties fail to agree, the Tribunal shall determine the place in accordance with the applicable arbitral rules, provided that the place shall be in the territory of a Party or of a third State that is a party to the New York Convention.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="30" title="Public access to hearings and documents">
          <p>1.  A Tribunal award under this Section shall be publicly available, subject to the redaction of confidential information. All other documents submitted to, or issued by, the Tribunal shall be publicly available unless the disputing parties otherwise agree, subject to the redaction of confidential information.</p>
          <p>2.  Hearings held under this Section shall be open to the public. The Tribunal may hold portions of hearings in camera to the extent necessary to ensure the protection of confidential information.</p>
          <p>3.  A disputing party may disclose to other persons in connection with the arbitral proceedings such unredacted documents as it considers necessary for the preparation of its case, but it shall ensure that those persons protect the confidential information in such documents.</p>
          <p>4.  The Parties may share with officials of their respective central and sub-national governments all relevant unredacted documents in the course of dispute settlement under this Agreement, but they shall ensure that those persons protect any confidential information in such documents.</p>
          <p>5.  If a Tribunal's order designates information as confidential and a Party's law on access to information requires public access to that information, the Party's law on access to information prevails. However, the Party should try to apply its law on access to information so as to protect information that the Tribunal's order has designated as confidential.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="31" title="Submissions by a non-disputing party">
          <p>A Tribunal has the authority to consider and accept written submissions from a person or entity that is not a disputing party with a significant interest in the arbitration. The Tribunal shall ensure that a non-disputing party submission does not disrupt the proceedings and does not unduly burden or unfairly prejudice a disputing party.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="32" title="Governing law">
          <p>1.  Tribunal established under this Section shall decide the issues in dispute consistently with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law. A joint interpretation by the Parties of a provision of this Agreement shall bind a Tribunal established under this Section, and an award under this Section must be consistent with that interpretation.</p>
          <p>2.  On the request of a respondent Party that asserts as a defence that the measure alleged to be a breach is within the scope of a reservation or exception set out in Article 16(1) (Reservations and Exceptions), or Annex I or Annex II, the Tribunal shall request the joint interpretation of the Parties on the issue. Within 60 days of the delivery of the request, the Parties shall submit in writing their joint interpretation to the Tribunal. The joint interpretation is binding on the Tribunal. If the Parties fail to submit their joint interpretation within 60 days of the Tribunal's request, the Tribunal shall decide the issue.</p>

        <div type="article" num="33" title="Expert reports">
          <p>1. Subject to paragraph 2, a Tribunal may appoint an expert to report to it in writing on a factual issue concerning environmental, health, safety or other scientific matter raised by a disputing party, subject to such terms and conditions as the disputing parties may decide.</p>
          <p>2. The Tribunal may not appoint an expert under paragraph 1 if the disputing parties agree that the Tribunal may not do so.</p>
          <p>3. Paragraph 1 does not affect the appointment of other kinds of experts where the appointment is authorized by the applicable arbitration rules.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="34" title="Interim measures of protection and final award">
          <p>1.  A Tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party or to ensure that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the Tribunal's jurisdiction. A Tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 20 (Claim by an Investor of a Party on Its Own Behalf or on Behalf of an Enterprise). For the purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a recommendation.</p>
          <p>2.  Where a Tribunal makes a final award against the disputing Party, the Tribunal may award, separately or in combination, only:</p>
          <p>(a)  monetary damages and any applicable interest;</p>
          <p>(b)  restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide that the disputing Party may pay monetary damages and any applicable interest in lieu of restitution.</p>
          <p>The Tribunal may also award costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.</p>
          <p>3.  Subject to paragraph 2, where a claim is made under Article 20(2) (Claim by a Disputing Investor of a Party on Its Own Behalf or on Behalf of an Enterprise):</p>
          <p>(a)  an award of monetary damages and any applicable interest shall provide that the sum be paid to the enterprise;</p>
          <p>(b)  an award of restitution of property shall provide that restitution be made to the enterprise; and</p>
          <p>(c)  the award shall provide that it is made without prejudice to a right that a person may have in monetary damages or property awarded under paragraphs (a) or (b) under a Party's domestic law.</p>
          <p>4.  A Tribunal may not award punitive damages.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="35" title="Finality and enforcement of an award">
          <p>1.  An award made by a Tribunal has no binding force except between the disputing parties and in respect of that particular case.</p>
          <p>2.  Subject to paragraph 3 and the applicable review procedure for an interim award, a disputing party shall abide by and comply with an award without delay.</p>
          <p>3.  A disputing party may not seek enforcement of a final award until:</p>
          <p>(a)  in the case of a final award made under the ICSID Convention:</p>
          <p>(i)  120 days have elapsed from the date the award was rendered and no disputing party has requested revision or annulment of the award, or</p>
          <p>(ii)  revision or annulment proceedings have been completed; and</p>
          <p>(b)  in the case of a final award under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules or the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules:</p>

          <p>(ii)  a court has dismissed or allowed an application to revise, set aside or annul the award and there is no further appeal.</p>
          <p>4.  Each Party shall provide for the enforcement of an award in its territory.</p>
          <p>5.  A claim that is submitted to arbitration under this Section shall be considered to arise out of a commercial relationship or transaction for purposes of Article I of the New York Convention.</p>

          <p>1.  A Party may request consultations on the interpretation or application of this Agreement. The other Party shall give sympathetic consideration to the request. A dispute between the Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall, whenever possible, be settled amicably through consultations.</p>
          <p>2.  If a dispute cannot be settled through consultations, it shall, at the request of either Party, be submitted to an arbitral panel for decision.</p>
          <p>3.  An arbitral panel shall be constituted for each dispute. Within two months after receipt through diplomatic channels of the request for arbitration, each Party shall appoint one member to the arbitral panel. The two members shall then select a national of a third State who, upon approval by the two Parties, shall be appointed Chair of the arbitral panel. The Chair shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two members of the arbitral panel.</p>
          <p>4.  If within the periods specified in paragraph 3 the necessary appointments have not been made, either Party may invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Party or is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Party or is prevented from discharging the said function, the Member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority, who is not a national of either Party, shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
          <p>5.  Arbitrators shall have expertise or experience in public international law, international trade or international investment rules, or the resolution of disputes arising under international trade or international investment agreements. They shall be independent of, and not be affiliated with or take instructions from, either Party.</p>
          <p>6.  Where a Party determines that the dispute involves measures relating to financial institutions, or to investors or investments of such investors in financial institutions, or where a Party invokes Article 11(6) (Transfers), 17(2) or 17(3) (General Exceptions), the arbitrators shall, in addition to the criteria set out in paragraph 5, have expertise or experience in financial services law or practice, which may include the regulation of financial institutions.</p>
          <p>7.  The arbitral panel shall determine its own procedure. The arbitral panel shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be binding on both Parties. Unless otherwise agreed, the decision of the arbitral panel shall be rendered within six months of the appointment of the Chair.</p>
          <p>8.  Each Party shall bear the costs of its own member of the panel and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings. The costs related to the Chair and any remaining costs shall be borne equally by the Parties. The arbitral panel may, however, award that a higher proportion of costs be borne by one of the two Parties, and this award shall be binding on both Parties.</p>
          <p>9.  Within 60 days of the decision of a panel, the Parties shall reach agreement on the manner in which to resolve their dispute. Such agreement shall normally implement the decision of the panel. If the Parties fail to reach agreement, the Party bringing the dispute shall be entitled to compensation or to suspend benefits of equivalent value to those awarded by the panel.</p>

    </conclusion>
    <attachments>
      <p>The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:</p>
      <p>(a)  indirect expropriation results from a measure or series of measures of a Party that has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure;</p>
      <p>(b)  the determination of whether a measure or series of measures of a Party constitutes an indirect expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:</p>
      <p>(i)  the economic impact of the measure or series of measures, although the sole fact that a measure or series of measures of a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred;</p>
      <p>(ii)  the extent to which the measure or series of measures interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; and</p>
      <p>(iii)  the character of the measure or series of measures.</p>
      <p>(c)  except in rare circumstances, such as when a measure or a series of measures is so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith, a non-discriminatory measure of a Party that is designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as health, safety and the environment, does not constitute indirect expropriation.</p>
      <p>Schedule of Canada</p>
      <p>In accordance with Article 16(2) of this Agreement, Canada reserves the right to adopt or maintain any measure that does not conform to the obligations set out below with respect to the following sectors or matters:</p>
      <p>Social services (i.e.: public law enforcement; correctional services, income security or insurance; social security or insurance; social welfare; public education; public training; health and child care), where the measure does not conform with the obligations imposed by Article 4 (National Treatment) or Article 8 (Senior Management, Boards of Directors and Entry of Personnel) of this Agreement;</p>
      <p>The rights or preferences provided to aboriginal peoples, where the measure does not conform with the obligations imposed by Article 4 (National Treatment), Article 5 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), Article 8 (Senior Management, Boards of Directors and Entry of Personnel) Article 9 (Performance Requirements) of this Agreement;</p>
      <p>The rights or preferences provided to socially or economically disadvantaged minorities, where the measure does not conform with the obligations imposed by Article 4 (National Treatment), Article 8 (Senior Management, Boards of Directors and Entry of Personnel) or Article 9 (Performance Requirements) of this Agreement;</p>
      <p>Residency requirements for ownership of oceanfront land, where the measure does not conform with the obligations imposed by Article 4 (National Treatment) of this Agreement;</p>
      <p>Government securities (i.e. acquisition, sale or other disposition by nationals of the other Party of bonds, treasury bills or other kinds of debt securities issued by the Government of Canada, a province or local government), where the measure does not conform with the obligations imposed by Article 4 (National Treatment) of this Agreement;</p>
      <p>Maritime cabotage, which means (a) the transportation of either goods or passengers by ship between points in the territory of Canada or above the continental shelf of Canada, directly or by way of a place outside Canada; but with respect to waters above the continental shelf of Canada, the transportation of either goods or passengers only in relation to the exploration, exploitation or transportation of the mineral or non-living natural resources of the continental shelf of Canada; and (b) the engaging by ship in any other marine activity of a commercial nature in the territory of Canada and, with respect to waters above the continental shelf, in such other marine activities of a commercial nature that are in relation to the exploration, exploitation or transportation of the mineral or non-living natural resources of the continental shelf of Canada; where the measure does not conform with the obligations imposed by Article 4 (National Treatment), Article 5 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), Article 8 (Senior Management, Boards of Directors and Entry of Personnel) or Article 9 (Performance Requirements) of this Agreement;</p>
      <p>Licensing fishing or fishing related activities, including entry of foreign fishing vessels to Canada's exclusive economic zone, territorial sea, internal waters or ports and use of any services therein, where the measure does not conform with the obligations imposed by Article 4 (National Treatment) or Article 5 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) of this Agreement;</p>
      <p>Telecommunications services, where the measure does not conform with the obligations imposed by Article 4 (National Treatment) or Article 8 (Senior Management, Boards of Directors and Entry of Personnel) of this Agreement by limiting foreign investment in facilities-based telecommunications service suppliers, requiring that such service suppliers be controlled in fact by a Canadian, requiring that at least 80 percent of the members of the board of directors of such suppliers be Canadian, and imposing cumulative foreign investment level restrictions; and</p>
      <p>The establishment or acquisition in Canada of an investment in the services sector, where the measure does not conform with the obligations imposed by Article 4 (National Treatment), Article 8 (Senior Management, Boards of Directors and Entry of Personnel) or Article 9 (Performance Requirements) of this Agreement, provided that the measure is consistent with Canada's obligations under Articles II, XVI, XVII and XVIII of the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services.</p>
      <p>Schedule of Moldova</p>
      <p>In accordance with the Article 16 (Reservations and Exceptions), the Republic of Moldova reserves the right to make and maintain exceptions with respect to the acquisition of land (agricultural land and forest land) by the foreign investors in towns and rural regions.</p>
      <p>1. Article 5 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) does not apply to treatment accorded by a Party under a bilateral, regional or multilateral international agreement in force or signed prior to 1 January 1994.</p>
      <p>2.  Article 5 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) does not apply to treatment accorded by a Party under an existing or future bilateral, regional or multilateral agreement:</p>
      <p>(a)  establishing, strengthening or expanding a free trade area or customs union;</p>
      <p>(b)  relating to:</p>
      <p>(i)  aviation;</p>
      <p>(ii)  fisheries; or</p>
      <p>(iii)  maritime matters, including salvage.</p>
      <p>A decision by Canada following a review under the Investment Canada Act, with respect to whether or not to permit an investment that is subject to review, is not subject to the dispute settlement provisions under Sections C (Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and the Host Party) or D (State to State Dispute Settlement Procedures) of this Agreement.</p>
