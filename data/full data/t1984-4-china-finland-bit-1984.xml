      <p>On signing the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Fin land and the Government of the People's Republic of China for the protection of investments, the duly authorized representatives of both Parties have agreed upon the following provisions which constitute an integral part of this Agreement: Article 1 Either Contracting Party shall, within the scope defined by its laws and reg ulations, give well-meaning consideration to entry and residence applications of the employees of investors of the other Contracting Party who wish to enter its territory in connection with the investment. Article 2 (1) If an investor considers the measure of expropriation in Article 5 incompatible with the laws of the Contracting Party taking the measure, the competent court of that Party shall, upon request of the investor, review the said measure. (2) If an investor whose investment has been expropriated challenges the amount of compensation for his assets, the investor and the Contracting Party which adopted the measure of expropriation shall consult with a view to reaching agreement on the amount of compensation within six months. (3) If the parties to the consultations do not reach agreement within the period set out in subparagraph (2) the competent court of the Contracting Party adopting the measure of expropriation or an international arbitral tribunal shall, upon the request of the investor, review the amount of the compensation. (4) The international arbitral tribunal referred to above shall be constituted for each case separately. Each party to the dispute shall appoint one member of the tribunal. These two members shall appoint a third person as chairman of the tribunal. The members shall be appointed within two months and the chairman within four months of the date on which either party receives from the other party to the dispute a request for arbitration. Should the appointments of members or chairman not take place within the time periods specified above, either party may, in case no other agreement has been made, refer the appointment to the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce. The arbitral tribunal shall determine its own procedures with reference to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Na tionals of Other States, done in Washington on 18 March, 1965.' The tribunal shall decide by majority vote and its decision shall be final and binding and can be enforced in accordance with domestic law. The tribunal shall, upon the request of either party to the dispute, state the reasons upon which the award is based. Each party to the dispute shall bear the cost of the arbitrator it has appointed. The cost of the chairman and other relevant costs of the tribunal shall be borne in equal parts by the parties to the dispute. Article 3 Unless otherwise agreed all other disputes over an investment between an investor and the Contracting Party receiving the investment shall be settled through local remedies of the Contracting Party in question and in accordance with its laws and regulations. Article 4 If an investor of one Contracting Party has an important interest in a company having its seat in a third State and having an important interest in a company of the other Contracting Party, the provisions of Article 5 of this Agreement shall apply to the investor in case the other Contracting Party takes measures of expropria tion against the investment assets of the company having its seat in the third State. However, the provisions relating to compensation for expropriation shall apply only when that company or the third State does not qualify for compensation or the said State abandons the right to request compensation. Article 5 If the treatment to be accorded by one Contracting Party under its laws and regulations to the investment of investors of the other Contracting Party is more favourable than the treatment provided by this Agreement, the more favourable treatment shall be applied. DONE in duplicate at Beijing this 4th day of September 1984 in the Finnish, Chinese and English languages, all texts being equally authoritative. In the case of divergence of interpretation the English text shall prevail.
