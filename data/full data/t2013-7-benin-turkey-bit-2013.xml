        <p>The Contracting Parties confirm their shared understanding that; </p>
        <p>1. An action or a series of actions by a Contracting Party cannot constitute an expropriation unless it interferes with a tangible or intangible property right or property interest in an investment. </p>
        <p>2. Article 6 [Expropriation and Compensation] paragraph 1 addresses two situations, The first is direct expropriation, where an investment is nationalized or otherwise directly expropriated through formal transfer of title or outright seizure. </p>
        <p>3. The second situation addressed by Article 6 [Expropriation and Compensation] paragraph 1 is indirect expropriation, where an action or series of actions by a Contracting Party has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure. </p>
        <p>(a) The determination of whether an action or series of actions by a Contracting Party, in a specific fact situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation, requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors: </p>
        <p>(i) the economic impact of the government action, although the fact that an action or series of actions by a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an&nbsp; investment, standing alone, does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred; </p>
        <p>(ii) the extent to which the government action interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; and </p>
        <p>(iii) the character of the government action. </p>
