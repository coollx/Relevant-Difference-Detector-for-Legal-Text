      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion and admission of investment">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create favourable conditions for investors of the other Contracting Party to make investments in its Area.</p>
        <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall, subject to its rights to exercise powers in accordance with its applicable laws and regulations, including those with regard to foreign ownership and control, admit investment of investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>3. It is confirmed that this Article shall not be construed to derogate from the obligations of each Contracting Party arising from the Agreement on Trade- Related Investment Measures in Annex 1A to the WTO Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="National treatment">
        <p>1. Once investment is admitted in accordance with its applicable laws and regulations, each Contracting Party shall in its Area accord to investors of the other Contracting Party and to their investments treatment no less favourable than the treatment it accords in like circumstances to its own investors and to their investments with respect to the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment and sale or other disposal of investments.</p>
        <p>2. Paragraph 1 shall not be construed so as to prevent a Contracting Party from adopting or maintaining a measure that prescribes special formalities in connection with the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment and sale or other disposal of investments of investors of the other Contracting Party in its Area, provided that such special formalities do not impair the substance of the rights of such investors under this Agreement.</p>
        <p>3. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to subsidies including grants, government supported loans, guarantees and insurance.</p>
        <p>4. Paragraph 1 does not prevent either Contracting Party from differentiating between treatments accorded in accordance with its laws and regulations relating to taxes.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="Most-favoured-nation treatment">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall in its Area accord to investors of the other Contracting Party and to their investments treatment no less favourable than the treatment it accords in like circumstances to investors of a non-Contracting Party and to their investments with respect to the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment and sale or other disposal of investments.</p>
        <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall in its Area accord to investors of the other Contracting Party and to their investments treatment no less favourable than the treatment it accords in like circumstances to investors of a non-Contracting Party and to their investments with respect to the matters relating to the admission of investment.</p>
        <p>3. Paragraph 2 shall not apply to:</p>
        <p>(a) the matters related to:</p>
        <p>(i) the acquisition of land property;</p>
        <p>(ii) subsidies; or</p>
        <p>(iii) government procurement;</p>
        <p>(b) any treatment accorded by a Contracting Party to investors of a non-Contracting Party and to their investments on the basis of reciprocity;</p>
        <p>(c) any preferential treatment resulting from the memberships to any bilateral or multilateral international agreement involving protection of new varieties of plants, aviation, fishery or maritime matters; and</p>
        <p>(d) any measure relating to investments in public law enforcement and correctional services, and in social services such as income security or insurance, social security or insurance, social welfare, primary and secondary education, public training, health and child care.</p>
        <p>4. Neither Contracting Party shall, under any measure adopted after the date of entry into force of this Agreement and covered by paragraph 3, require an investor of the other Contracting Party, by reason of its nationality, to sell or otherwise dispose of an investment that exists at the time when the measure becomes effective.</p>
        <p>5. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not be construed so as to oblige a Contracting Party to extend to the investors of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from any existing or future free trade area, customs union, economic union, or other form of regional agreement, to which the former Contracting Party is a party.</p>
        <p>6. For greater certainty, it is understood that the treatment referred to in this Article does not include treatment accorded to investors of a non-Contracting Party and their investments by provisions concerning the settlement of investment disputes such as the mechanism set out in Article 17 that are provided for in other international bilateral and multilateral agreements between a Contracting Party and a non-Contracting Party or non- Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>7. Paragraph 1 shall not be construed so as to oblige a Contracting Party to extend to investors of the other Contracting Party special tax advantages accorded to investors of a non-Contracting Party, on the basis of reciprocity with the non-Contracting Party or by virtue of any agreement relating to taxes in force between the former Contracting Party and the non-Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="General treatment and improvement of investment environment">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall in its Area accord to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party treatment in accordance with customary international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.</p>
        <p>For great certainty, the concept of "fair and equitable treatment" and "full protection and security" do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.</p>
        <p>2. Neither Contracting Party shall, within its Area, in any way impair the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment and sale or other disposal of investments of investors of the other Contracting Party by arbitrary measures.</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Access to the courts of justice">
        <p>Each Contracting Party shall in its Area accord to investors of the other Contracting Party treatment no less favourable than the treatment which it accords in like circumstances to its own investors or investors of a non- Contracting Party with respect to access to the courts of justice and administrative tribunals and agencies in all degrees of jurisdiction, both in pursuit and in defence of such investors' rights.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Prohibition of performance requirements">
        <p>1.

        <p>For greater certainty, a "licence contract" referred to in this subparagraph means any licence contract concerning transfer of technology, a production process, or other proprietary knowledge.</p>
        <p>2. Neither Contracting Party may condition the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment and sale or other disposal of investments of an investor of a Contracting Party or of a non-Contracting Party in its Area, on compliance with any of the following requirements:</p>

        <p>(b) Subparagraphs 1(g) and 1(k) shall not apply when the requirement is imposed or the commitment or undertaking is enforced by a court of justice, administrative tribunal or competition authority to remedy a practice determined after judicial or administrative process to be anti-competitive under competition laws.</p>

        <p>If a Contracting Party or its designated agency makes a payment to any investor of that Contracting Party under an indemnity, guarantee or insurance contract, pertaining to an investment of such investor in the Area of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall recognise the assignment to the former Contracting Party or its designated agency of any right or claim of such investor on account of which such payment is made and shall recognise the right of the former Contracting Party or its designated agency to exercise by virtue of subrogation any such right or claim to the same extent as the original right or claim of the investor. As regards payment to be made to that former Contracting Party or its designated agency by virtue of such assignment of right or claim and the transfer of such payment, the provisions of Articles 12, 13 and 15 shall apply mutatis mutandis.</p>

      <div type="article" num="17" title="Settlement of investment disputes between a contracting party and an investor of the other contracting party">
        <p>1. For the purposes of this Article, "investment dispute" is a dispute between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party that has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, an alleged breach of any obligation of the former Contracting Party under this Agreement with respect to investments of the investor of that other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>2. Subject to subparagraph 5(b), nothing in this Article shall be construed so as to prevent an investor who is a party to an investment dispute (hereinafter referred to in this Article as "disputing investor") from seeking administrative or judicial settlement in the Contracting Party that is a party to the investment dispute (hereinafter referred to in this Article as "disputing Party").</p>
        <p>3. An investment dispute shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably through consultations or negotiations between the disputing investor and the disputing Party (hereinafter referred to in this Article as "the disputing parties").</p>
        <p>4. If any investment dispute cannot be settled through such consultations or negotiations within six months from the date on which the disputing investor requested in writing the disputing Party for consultations or negotiations, the disputing investor may, subject to subparagraph 5(a), submit the investment dispute to one of the following international arbitrations:</p>
        <p>(a) arbitration in accordance with the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (hereinafter referred to in this Article as "ICSID Convention"), so long as the ICSID Convention is in force between the Contracting Parties;</p>
        <p>(b) arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, provided that either Contracting Party, but not both, is a party to the ICSID Convention;</p>
        <p>(c) arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law; or</p>
        <p>(d) any arbitration in accordance with other arbitration rules, if agreed with the disputing Party.</p>
        <p>5. (a) In the event that an investment dispute has been submitted to courts of justice, administrative tribunals or agencies or any other binding dispute settlement mechanism established under the laws and regulations of the disputing Party, any arbitration set forth in paragraph 4 can be sought only if the disputing investor withdraws, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the disputing Party, its claim from such domestic remedies before the final decisions are made therein.</p>
        <p>(b) In the event that an investment dispute has been submitted for resolution under one of the arbitrations set forth in paragraph 4, the same investment dispute shall not be submitted for resolution under courts of justice, administrative tribunals or agencies or any other binding dispute settlement mechanism established under the laws and regulations of the disputing Party.</p>

Notwithstanding paragraph 8, no claim may be submitted to arbitration set forth in paragraph 4, if more than five years have elapsed since the date on which the disputing investor acquired or should have first acquired, whichever is the earlier, the knowledge that the disputing investor had incurred loss or damage referred to in paragraph 1.</p>

        <p>19. The award rendered by the arbitral tribunal shall include:</p>
        <p>(a) a judgment whether or not there has been a breach by the disputing Party of any obligation under this Agreement with respect to the disputing investor and its investments; and</p>

        <p>(b) information which is privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure under the applicable laws and regulations of either Contracting Party; and</p>
        <p>(c) information which the disputing Party must withhold pursuant to the relevant arbitration rules, as applied.</p>
