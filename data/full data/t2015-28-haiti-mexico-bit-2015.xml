      <p>Contracting parties confirm their common understanding in that:</p>

      <p>3. The second situation covers appropriations under article 7, paragraph 1. It is indirect expropriation measure or, where a series of measures of a contracting party having an equivalent effect to expropriation without the direct transfer form the direct title ownership or seizure.</p>
      <p>The determination of whether a measure or series of measures of a contracting party in fact constitutes a specific situation, an indirect expropriation requires a case by case factual investigation; consider among other factors: the economic impact of the Government although the sole fact that a measure or series of measures of a Contracting party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment alone does not establish that has occurred an indirect expropriation; the extent to which the Government action interferes with clear and reasonable expectations of investment; the type of action of the Government as the non-discriminatory measures of a contracting party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives such as public health, safety, the protection and promotion of international and national labor rights, and the environment, do not constitute an indirect expropriation, provided that such measures are not used as a means to violate the provisions of disguised.</p>
