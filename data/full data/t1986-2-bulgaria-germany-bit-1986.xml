    <preamble>
      <p>The Federal Republic of Germany and the People's Republic of Bulgaria,</p>
      <p>Desiring to intensify economic cooperation between both States,</p>
      <p>Intending to create favourable conditions for investments by investors of either State in the territory of the other State,</p>
      <p>Recognizing that contractual encouragement and contractual protection of such investments in the two States Parties to the Treaty serve to consolidate economic cooperation,</p>
      <p>Mindful of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe,</p>
      <p>Have agreed as follows:</p>
    </preamble>
    <body>

        <p>(3) The term "investors" shall mean</p>
        <p>In respect of the Federal Republic of Germany:</p>
        <p>1. Germans with a residence within the area of application of this Treaty,</p>
        <p>2. Any juridical person as well as any commercial or other company or association with or without legal personality having its seat in the area of application of this Treaty and lawfully existing consistent with legal provisions, irrespective of whether the liability of its partners, associates or members is limited or unlimited and whether or not it operates for profit,</p>
        <p>In respect of the People's Republic of Bulgaria:</p>
        <p>Any juridical person as well as any economic company or other company or association with or without legal personality having its seat in the area of application of this Treaty and which is registered, in so far as this is required under Bulgarian legislation, whether or not it operates for profit, that under the terms of this Treaty make investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote, so far as possible, investment by investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>(2) Each Contracting Party shall admit investments by investors of the other Contracting Party in accordance with its legislation.</p>
        <p>(3) Investments which are permitted in accordance with the legislation of either Contracting Party shall enjoy the protection of this Treaty. Returns from the investment shall enjoy the same protection.</p>
        <p>(4) Each Contracting Party shall in any case accord investments by investors of the other Contracting Party fair and equitable treatment.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3">
        <p>(1) Neither Contracting Party shall, in its territory, subject investments from investors of the other Contracting Party to treatment less favourable than it accords to investments from investors of third countries.</p>
        <p>(2) Neither Contracting Party shall subject investors of the other Contracting Party, as regards their activity in connection with investments in its territory, to treatment less favourable than it accords to investors of third countries.</p>

        <p>&#x2010; With regard to membership of a customs union, a free-trade area or a common market,</p>
        <p>&#x2010; By virtue of a double taxation agreement or other agreements regarding matters of taxation.</p>
        <p>(5) Should there result from the legislation of either Contracting Party or from obligations under international law which go beyond this Treaty between the Contracting Parties, or which will be established in future, a provision whereby investors of the other Contracting Party or their investments are to be accorded treatment more favourable than that provided under this Treaty, that provision shall take precedence to the extent that it is more favourable.</p>
        <p>(6) Each Contracting Party shall comply with all other obligations entered into with regard to investments from investors of the other Contracting Party in its territory.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4">
        <p>(1) Investments from investors of either Contracting Party shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>(2) Investments from investors of either Contracting Party shall not be expropriated in the territory of the other Contracting Party except on the basis of legislation in the public interest and against compensation.

The compensation shall be paid without delay following the expropriation; it shall be effectively realizable and freely transferable.</p>
        <p>(3) The lawfulness of the expropriation shall, at the request of the investor, be reviewed in a properly constituted legal proceeding of the Contracting Party which has carried out the expropriation measure.

If agreement has not been reached within three months from the commencement of the consultations, the amount of the compensation shall, at the request of the investor, be reviewed either in a properly constituted proceeding of the Contracting Party that has carried out the expropriaton measure, or by means of an international arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>(4) Investors of either Contracting Party who suffer investment losses as a result of war or other armed conflict, national emergency or other comparable events in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall be accorded treatment by that Contracting Party no less favourable than that accorded to investors of third countries in respect of any restitution, indemnities or other valuable consideration; companies in which investors of the other Contracting Party hold an interest shall in such cases be accorded treatment no less favourable than that accorded to companies in which investors of third countries hold an interest. Payments shall be freely transferable.</p>
        <p>(5) In matters governed by this article, the investments and investors of either Contracting Party shall enjoy treatment in the territory of the other Contracting Party that is no less favourable than that enjoyed by investments and investors of those third States that receive most favourable treatment in this respect.</p>

      <div type="article" num="5">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall guarantee to investors of the other Contracting Party free transfer of payments in connection with investments, in particular of the capital, the returns and, in the event of liquidation or sale, of the proceeds of the liquidation or sale.</p>
        <p>(2) Transfers under articles 4, 5 and 6 shall be effected at the appropriate exchange rates of the country concerned.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6">
        <p>If either Contracting Party makes payment to its investors under a guarantee that it has assumed in respect of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall, without prejudice to the rights of the former Contracting Party under article 7, recognize the assignment, whether under law or pursuant to a legal transaction, of any right or claim from such investors to the former Contracting Party. The latter Contracting Party shall also recognize the subrogation of the former Contracting Party to any such right or claim (assigned claims) which that Contracting Party shall be entitled to assert to the same extent as its predecessor in title. As regards the transfer of payments to be made to the Contracting Party concerned by virtue of which assignment, article 4, paragraph 2, and article 5 shall apply mutatis mutandis.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7">

The arbitral tribunal may make a different regulation concerning costs. In all other respects, the arbitral tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>

      <p>PROTOCOL</p>
      <p>On signing the Treaty concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Federal Republic of Germany and the People's Republic of Bulgaria, the undersigned plenipotentiaries have, in addition, agreed on the following provisions which shall be regarded as an integral part of the said Treaty:</p>
      <div type="article" num="(1" title="Ad Article 3">
        <p>The following shall more particularly, though not exclusively, be deemed "activity" within the meaning of article 3: the management, maintenance, use and enjoyment of an investment. The following shall, in particular, be deemed "treatment less favourable" within the meaning of article 3: restricting the purchase of raw or auxiliary materials, of energy or fuel or of means of production or operation of any kind, impeding the marketing of products inside or outside the country, as well as any other measures having similar effects. Measures that have to be taken for reasons of public security and order, public health or morality shall not be deemed "treatment less favourable".</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="(2" title="Ad Article 4">
        <p>(a) The provisions of article 4 shall also apply to the nationalization or taking into public control of an investment and to any other withdrawal or restriction of property rights by means of sovereign measures, the effects of which are equivalent to an expropriation.</p>
        <p>(b) The international arbitral tribunal referred to in paragraph 3 shall be constituted ad hoc as follows: Each Party shall appoint one member and these two members shall agree upon a national of a third State as their chairman. Such members shall be appointed within two months, and such chairman within three months, from the date on which either Party has informed the other Party that it intends to submit the dispute to an arbitral tribunal. If the periods specified above have not been observed, either Party may, in the absence of any other relevant arrangement, invite the chairman of the international arbitral tribunal in the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce to make the necessary appointments. The chairman and members of the arbitral tribunal must be citizens of a State with which both Contracting Parties have diplomatic relations.</p>
        <p>The arbitral tribunal shall establish its own procedures under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) of 15 December 1976. The tribunal shall reach its decisions by a majority vote; its decisions shall be final and binding. They shall be applied in accordance with national law. The decision must state the bases on which it is issued. The grounds for the decision must be specified if either Party so requests.</p>
        <p>Each Party shall bear the cost of its own member and of its representation in the arbitral procedures; the cost of the chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by both Parties.</p>
        <p>(c) In the consultations and arbitral procedures referred to in article 4, paragraph 3, the Contracting Parties shall be represented by their competent ministries.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="(3" title="Ad Article 5">
        <p>(a) The transfer shall be deemed to have been made "without delay" for the purpose of article 5, paragraph 2, if effected within the period normally required for the completion of transfer formalities. The period shall commence on the day on which the relevant request has been submitted and may on no account exceed two months.</p>
        <p>(b) In article 5, the expression "each Contracting Party shall guarantee to investors of the other Contracting Party the free transfer of payments in connection with investments, in particular of the capital, returns and, in the event of liquidation or sale, of the proceeds of the liquidation or sale" shall mean, in respect of the People's Republic of Bulgaria: in accordance with the foreign-currency regulations of the People's Republic of Bulgaria at the time the present Treaty is signed, payments under article 5 from the funds of mixed companies shall be transferred abroad from their foreign-currency account. If the mixed company does not have sufficient foreign-currency reserves for the payments under article 5, the National Bank of Bulgaria shall make available the foreign-currency reserves necessary for the transfer in exchange for national currency. With regard to the transfer of profits and interest, the above provision shall apply if the mixed company is carrying on an economic activity with the authorization of the appropriate Bulgarian authorities, the earnings from which shall be wholly or partly in national currency.</p>
        <p>Done at Hanover on 12 April 1986, in two originals, in the German and Bulgarian languages, both texts being equally authentic.</p>
