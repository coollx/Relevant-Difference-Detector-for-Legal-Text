    </title>
    <preamble>
      <p>The Government of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Government of the Republic of Ecuador,</p>
      <p>Desiring to intensify economic cooperation to the mutual benefit of both countries and to maintain fair and equitable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party,</p>
      <p>Conscious of the need to establish an adequate legal framework regulating and ensuring the promotion and reciprocal protection of investments between the two Contracting Parties,</p>
      <p>Recognizing that the promotion and reciprocal protection of such investments favour the expansion of the economic relations between the two Contracting Parties and stimulate investment initiatives,</p>
      <p>Have agreed as follows:</p>
    </preamble>
    <body>
      <div type="article" num="1" title="Definitions">
        <p>For the purposes of this Agreement:</p>
        <p>(1) "Investment" shall mean any kind of asset owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, provided that the investment has been made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the other Contracting Party, and shall include in particular, though not exclusively:</p>
        <p>(a) Movable and immovable property as well as any other property rights, such as mortgage, pledge, usufruct and similar rights;</p>
        <p>(b) Shares, stock, participation in companies and any other kind of shared risk in an enterprise;</p>
        <p>(c) Title to money or any performance having an economic value related to a specific investment;</p>
        <p>(d) Intellectual property rights, technical processes, trade names, know-how, goodwill, rights of breeders of new plant varieties and other similar rights;</p>
        <p>(e) Any right conferred by law or contract or by virtue licences or permits including economic concessions to search for, develop, extract or exploit natural resources.</p>
        <p>A change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect their character as investments.</p>
        <p>(2) "investor" shall mean:</p>
        <p>(a) Any natural person who is a national of a Contracting Party in accordance with its laws; and</p>
        <p>(b) Any legal person, such as a company, corporation, firm, business association, institution or other entity, constituted in accordance with the laws and regulations of a Contracting Party and having its seat in the territory of that Contracting Party; and</p>
        <p>(c) Any legal person not organized under the laws and regulations of a Contracting Party but controlled, directly or indirectly, by a national or a legal person of that Contracting Party, as defined under (a) or under (b).</p>
        <p>(3) "returns" shall mean the amounts yielded by an investment and in particular, though not exclusively, include profit, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties or any payment in kind related to an investment.</p>
      </div>

        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall, subject to its laws and regulations, promote and admit in its territory investments by investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>(2) Subject to the laws and regulations relating to the entry and sojourn of aliens, individuals working for an investor of one Contracting Party, as well as members of their household, shall be permitted to enter into, remain on and leave the territory of the other Contracting Party for the purpose of carrying out activities associated with investments in the territory of the latter Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>(3) Each Contracting Party shall, at all times, ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof nor the acquisition of goods and services or the sale of their production, through unreasonable or discriminatory measures.</p>
        <p>(4) The investments, made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory they are undertaken, shall enjoy the full protection of this Agreement and in no case shall a Contracting Party award treatment less favourable than that required by international law. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it has entered into with an investor of the other Contracting Party with regard to this investment.</p>
        <p>(5) Returns yielded from an investment shall be given the same treatment and protection as an investment.</p>
        <p>(6) Goods, that under a leasing agreement are placed at the disposal of a lessee in the territory of one Contracting Party by a lessor being an investor of the other Contracting Party, shall be treated not less favourably than an investment.</p>

      <div type="article" num="3" title="National and Most Favoured Nation Treatment of Investment">
        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall apply to investments made in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party a treatment which is no less favourable than that accorded to investments made by its own investors or by investors of third States, whichever is the more favourable.</p>

        <p>(3) The provisions of Paragraph (1) of this Article shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to investors of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from any international agreement or arrangement relating wholly or mainly to taxation or any domestic legislation relating wholly or mainly to taxation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="Expropriation and Compensation">

        <p>Such fair market value shall at the request of the investor be expressed in a freely convertible currency on the basis of the market rate of exchange existing for that currency on the Valuation Date. Compensation shall also include interest at a commercial rate established on a market basis from the date of expropriation until the date of payment.</p>
        <p>(3) The provisions of Paragraph (1) and (2) of this Article shall also apply to the returns from an investment as well as, in the event of liquidation, to the proceeds from the liquidation.</p>
        <p>(4) Investors of either Contracting Party who suffer losses of their investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party due to war or other armed conflict, a state of national emergency, revolt, insurrection or riot shall be accorded, with respect to restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement, a treatment which is no less favourable than that accorded to its own investors or to investors of any third State.

      <div type="article" num="5" title="Transfers">

        <p>(b) Funds necessary:</p>

        <p>(ii) To replace capital assets in order to safeguard the continuity of an investment;</p>
        <p>(c) Returns;</p>
        <p>(d) The proceeds from a total or partial sale or liquidation of an investment;</p>
        <p>(e) Funds in repayment of loans;</p>
        <p>(f) Payments arising under Article 4;</p>
        <p>(g) Earnings of individuals, not being its nationals, who are allowed to work in connection with an investment in its territory.</p>
        <p>(2) Transfers shall be effected in a freely convertible currency at the market rate of exchange existing on the day of transfer with respect to spot transactions in the currency to be transferred. In the absence of a market for foreign exchange, the rate to be used will be the most recent rate applied to inward investments or the most recent exchange rate for conversion of currencies into Special Drawing Rights, whichever is the most favourable to the investor.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If a Contracting Party or its designated agency makes a payment to any of its investors under a guarantee it has granted in respect of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall, without prejudice to the rights of the former Contracting Party under Article 9, recognize the transfer of any right or title of such an investor to the former Contracting Party or its designated agency and the right of the former Contracting Party or its designated agency to exercise by virtue of subrogation any such right or title to the same extent as its predecessor in title.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Consultations">

        <p>(1) Any dispute concerning an investment between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party shall, if possible, be settled amicably.</p>
        <p>(2) If any such dispute cannot be settled within six months following the date on which the dispute has been raised by the investor through written notification to the Contracting Party, each Contracting Party hereby consents to the submission of the dispute, at the investor's choice, for resolution by international arbitration to one of the following fora:</p>

        <p>If the parties to such a dispute have different opinions as to whether concilation or arbitration is the more appropriate method of settlement, the investor shall have the right to choose.</p>
        <p>(3) For the purpose of this Article and Article 25 (2) (b) of the said Washington Convention, any legal person which is constituted in accordance with the legislation of one Contracting Party and in which, before a dispute arises, an investor of the other Contracting Party held a predominant interest shall be treated as a legal person of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>(4) Any arbitration shall be held in a state that is a party to the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York, June 10, 1958.</p>
