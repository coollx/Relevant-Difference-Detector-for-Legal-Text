          <p>2.  The compensation referred to in paragraph 1 must be equivalent to the real value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation took place ("date of expropriation"), and must not reflect a change in value occurring because the intended expropriation had become known earlier. Valuation criteria must include going concern value, asset value including the declared tax value of tangible property, and other criteria, as appropriate, to determine the real value.</p>
          <p>3.  Compensation shall be paid without delay and shall be fully realizable and freely transferable. Compensation shall be paid in a freely convertible currency and shall include interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that currency accrued from the date of expropriation until the date of payment.</p>

          <p>3.  Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, a Party may prevent a transfer through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of its domestic law relating to:</p>

          <p>5.  Paragraph 4 does not prevent a Party from imposing a measure through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of its domestic law relating to the matters in subparagraphs 3(a) through 3(e).</p>
          <p>6.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 4, and without limiting the applicability of paragraph 5, a Party may prevent or limit transfers by a financial institution to, or for the benefit of, an affiliate of or person related to that institution, through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of a measure relating to maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or financial responsibility of financial institutions.</p>
          <p>7.  Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a Party may restrict transfers of returns in kind in circumstances where it could otherwise restrict those transfers under the WTO Agreement and as set out in paragraph 3.</p>

          <p>(a)  publish in advance any measure referred to in paragraph 1 that it proposes to adopt; and</p>
          <p>(b)  provide interested persons and the other Party a reasonable opportunity to comment on that proposed measure.</p>
          <p>3.  Upon request by a Party, the other Party shall provide information on a measure that may have an impact on a covered investment.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="13" title="Subrogation">
          <p>1.  If a Party or an agency of a Party makes a payment to one of its investors under a guarantee or a contract of insurance it has entered into in respect of an investment, the other Party shall recognize the validity of the subrogation in favour of the first-mentioned Party or agency to a right or title held by the investor.</p>
          <p>2.  A Party or an agency of a Party, that is subrogated to a right of an investor in accordance with paragraph 1, is entitled to the same rights as those of the investor regarding the investment.</p>
          <p>Those rights may be exercised by the Party or an agency of the Party or by the investor if the Party or its agency so authorizes.</p>

          <p>4.  Provided that the conditions in paragraph 5 are met:</p>
          <p>(a)  a claim by an investor that a taxation measure of a Party is in breach of an agreement between a Government authority of that Party and the investor concerning an investment shall be considered a claim for breach of this Agreement; andng taxation measure;</p>
          <p>(b)  Article 10 (Expropriation) applies to taxation measures.</p>
          <p>5.  An investor may not make a claim under paragraph 4 unless:</p>
          <p>(a)  the investor provides a copy of the notice of claim to the taxation authorities of the Parties; and</p>
          <p>(b)  six months after receiving notification of the claim by the investor, the taxation authorities of the Parties fail to reach a joint determination that, in the case of subparagraph 4(a), the measure does not contravene that agreement, or in the case of subparagraph 4(b), the measure is not an expropriation.</p>
          <p>6.  If, in connection with a claim by an investor of a Party or a dispute between the Parties, an issue arises as to whether a measure of a Party is a taxation measure, a Party may refer the issue to the taxation authorities of the Parties. A joint determination of the taxation authorities shall bind a Tribunal formed pursuant to Section C (Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and the Host Party) or an arbitral panel formed pursuant to Section D (Settlement of Disputes between the Parties). A Tribunal or arbitral panel seized of a claim or a dispute in which the issue arises may not proceed until it receives the joint determination of the taxation authorities. If the taxation authorities have not determined the issue within six months from the date of the referral, the Tribunal or arbitral panel shall decide the issue.</p>
          <p>7.  Each Party shall notify the other Party in writing of the identity and contact information of the taxation authorities referred to in this Article.</p>

          <p>The Parties recognize that it is inappropriate to encourage investment by relaxing their health, safety or environmental measures. Accordingly, a Party should not waive or otherwise derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from, those measures to encourage the establishment, acquisition, expansion or retention in its area of an investment of an investor. If a Party considers that the other Party has offered such an encouragement, it may request consultations with the other Party and the two Parties shall consult with a view to avoiding the encouragement.</p>

      <p>Expropriation</p>
      <p>The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:</p>
      <p>(a)  indirect expropriation results from a measure or a series of measures of a Party that has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure;</p>
      <p>(b)  the determination of whether a measure or a series of measures of a Party constitutes an indirect expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:</p>
      <p>O (i) the economic impact of the measure or the series of measures, although the sole fact that a measure or a series of measures of a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred,</p>
      <p>O (ii) the extent to which the measure or the series of measures interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations, and o (iii) the character of the measure or the series of measures;</p>
      <p>(c)  except in rare circumstances, such as when a measure or a series of measures is so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith, a non-discriminatory measure of a Party that is designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as health, safety and the environment, does not constitute indirect expropriation.</p>
