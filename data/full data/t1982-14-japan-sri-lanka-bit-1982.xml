      <div type="article" num="2">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall, subject to its rights to exercise powers in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations, encourage and create favourable conditions for nationals and companies of the other Contracting Party to make investment in its territory, and, subject to the same rights, shall admit such investment.</p>
        <p>2. Nationals and companies of either Contracting Party shall within the territory of the other Contracting Party be accorded treatment no less favourable than that accorded to nationals and companies of any third country in regard to the matters relating to the admission of investment.</p>
        <p>3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of the present Article, either Contracting Party may require that the treatment with respect to rights on immovable property shall be accorded on the basis of reciprocity.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3">
        <p>1. Neither Contracting Party shall within its territory subject investments and returns of nationals and companies of the other Contracting Party to treatment less favourable than that accorded to investments and returns of nationals and companies of the former Contracting Party or of nationals and companies of any third country.</p>
        <p>2. Nationals and companies of either Contracting Party shall within the territory of the other Contracting Party be accorded treatment no less favourable than that accorded to nationals and companies of such other Contracting Party or to nationals and companies of any third country in all matters relating to their business activities in connection with their investment.</p>
        <p>3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of the present Article, either Contracting Party may:</p>
        <p>(1) Exclude the grant of national treatment to:</p>

        <p>Nationals and companies of either Contracting Party shall within the territory of the other Contracting Party be accorded treatment no less favourable than that accorded to nationals and companies of such other Contracting Party or to nationals and companies of any third country with respect to access to the courts of justice and administrative tribunals and agencies in all degrees of jurisdiction both in pursuit and in defence of their rights.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5">
        <p>1. Investments and returns of nationals and companies of either Contracting Party shall receive the most constant protection and security within the territory of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>2. Investments and returns of nationals and companies of either Contracting Party shall not be subjected to expropriation, nationalization, restriction or any other measure the effects of which would be tantamount to expropriation or nationalization, within the territory of the other Contracting Party unless such measures are taken for a public purpose and under due process of law; are not discriminatory; and, are taken against prompt, adequate and effective compensation.</p>
        <p>3. The compensation referred to in the provisions of paragraph 2 of the present Article shall represent the equivalent of the normal market value of the investments and returns affected at the time when expropriation, nationalization, restriction or any other comparable measure was publicly announced or when such measure was taken, whichever is the earlier, without reduction in that value due to the prospect of the very seizure which ultimately occurs. Such compensation shall be paid without delay and shall carry an appropriate interest taking into account the length of time until the time of payment. It shall be effectively realizable and freely transferable at the exchange rate prevailing on the date used for the determination of value. Adequate provision shall have been made in an appropriate manner at or prior to the time of expropriation, nationalization, restriction or any other comparable measure for the determination and payment thereof.</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6">
        <p>Nationals and companies of either Contracting Party who suffer within the territory of the other Contracting Party damages in relation to their investments, returns, or activities in connection with their investment, owing to the outbreak of hostilities or a state of national emergency, shall be accorded treatment no less favourable than that accorded to nationals and companies of such other Contracting Party or to nationals and companies of any third country, as regards restitution, compensation or other valuable consideration. Payments made under the present Article shall be effectively realizable and freely transferable.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7">
        <p>If either Contracting Party makes payment to any of its nationals or companies under a guarantee it has assumed in respect of investments and returns in the territory of the other Contracting Party, such other Contracting Party shall recognize the transfer to the former Contracting Party of any right or claim of such national or company in such investments and returns on account of which such payment is made and the subrogation of the former Contracting Party to any claim or cause of action of such national or company arising in connection therewith. As regards the transfer of payment to be made to that former Contracting Party by virtue of such transfer of right or claim, the provisions of paragraphs 2 to 5 of Article 5, Article 6 and Article 8 shall apply mutatis mutandis.</p>

        <p>2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of the present Article, either Contracting Party may, in exceptional financial or economic circumstances, impose such exchange restrictions in accordance with its laws and in conformity with the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund so long as such Contracting Party is a party to the said Articles of Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9">
        <p>The present Agreement shall also apply to investments and returns of nationals and companies of either Contracting Party acquired within the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations of such other Contracting Party prior to the entering into force of the present Agreement.</p>
      </div>

        <p>The provisions of the present Agreement shall apply irrespective of the existence of diplomatic or consular relations between the Contracting Parties.</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="12">
        <p>1. Companies in which nationals and companies of either Contracting Party have a substantial interest shall within the territory of the other Contracting Party be accorded:</p>
