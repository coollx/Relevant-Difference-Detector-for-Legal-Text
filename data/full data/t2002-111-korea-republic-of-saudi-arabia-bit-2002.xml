        <p>(1) Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote as far as possible investments by investors of the other Contracting Party and admit such investments in accordance with its laws and regulations. It shall in any case accord such investments fair and equitable treatment.</p>
        <p>(2) Investments by investors of either Contracting Party shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.

        <p>(2) In accordance with its laws and regulations, each Contracting Party shall grant investments once admitted and investment returns of the investors of the other Contracting Party a treatment not less favourable than that accorded to investments and investment returns of its investors.</p>
        <p>(3) Each Contracting Party shall accord to the investors of the other Contracting Party in connection with the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments or with the means to assure their rights to such investments, like transfers and indemnification or with any other activity associated with this in its territory, treatment not less favourable than the treatment it accords to its investors or to the investors of any third state, whichever is more favourable.</p>

      <div type="article" num="6">
        <p>If a Contracting Party or any related agency makes a payment to an investor under a guarantee it has assumed in respect of an investment made by that investor in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall recognize the transfer of any rights or claim from the investor or any of its affiliates to the former Contracting Party or any related agency.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7">
        <p>(1) Transfers under paragraphs (1) or (2) of Article 4, Article 5 or Article 6 shall be made without delay at the prevailing rate of exchange in freely convertible currency which is widely used to make payments for international transactions and widely exchanged in principal international exchange markets.</p>
        <p>(2) This rate of exchange shall be market rate of exchange prevailing on the date of application for transfer or the exchange rate for conversion of currencies into Special Drawing Rights on the date of application for transfer, whichever is more favourable to the investors.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8">
        <p>(1) If the treatment accorded by either Contracting Party, according to its laws, regulations or international agreements to which both Contracting Parties are parties, to investments or activities in connection with investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party is more favourable than that provided for in this Agreement, the more favourable treatment shall be accorded.</p>
        <p>(2) Each Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>

      <div type="article" num="10">
        <p>(1) Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement should as far as possible be settled by the two Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>(2) If a dispute cannot thus be settled within six (6) months, it shall upon the request of either Contracting Party be submitted to an arbitration tribunal.</p>
        <p>(3) Such arbitration tribunal shall be constituted ad hoc as follows: each Contracting Party shall appoint one member, and these two members shall agree upon a national of a third state as their Chairman to be appointed by the two Contracting Parties. Such members shall be appointed within two (2) months, and such Chairman within three (3) months from the date on which either Contracting Party has informed the other Contracting Party that it intends to submit the dispute to an arbitration tribunal.</p>
        <p>(4) If the periods specified in paragraph (3) of this Article have not been observed, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other arrangement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice President should make the necessary appointments. If the Vice President is a national of either Contracting Party or is prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party should make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>(5) The arbitration tribunal shall reach its decisions by a majority of votes. Such decisions shall be final and binding. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own member and the cost counselling in the arbitration proceedings.

        <p>(2) If the dispute cannot be settled in the way prescribed in paragraph (1) of this Article within six (6) months from the date when the request for the settlement was submitted, it shall at the request of the investor be filed with the competent court of law of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made, or filed for arbitration under the Convention of 18th March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States.</p>
        <p>(3) If the dispute is submitted in accordance with paragraph (2) to the competent court of the Contracting Party, the investor cannot at the same time seek international arbitration. If the dispute is filed for arbitration, the award shall be binding and shall not be subject to any appeal or remedy other than those provided for in the said Convention. The award shall be enforced in accordance with domestic law.</p>
