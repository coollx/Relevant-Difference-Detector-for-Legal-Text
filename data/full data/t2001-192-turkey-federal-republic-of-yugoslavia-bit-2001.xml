As far as possible, the investor and the concerned Party shall endeavour to settle these disputes by consultations and negotiations in good faith.</p>

        <p>(a) The International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) set up by the "Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of other States", in case both Parties become signatories of this Convention,</p>
        <p>(b) An ad hoc court of arbitration laid down under the Arbitration Rules of Procedure of the United Nations Commission for International Trade Law (UNCITRAL),</p>
        <p>(c) The Court of Arbitration of the Paris International Chamber of Commerce, provided that, if the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the local courts of the Party that is a party to the dispute and a final award has not been rendered within one year.</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="VIII" title="Settlement of disputes between the parties">
        <p>1. The Parties shall seek in good faith and a spirit of cooperation a rapid and equitable solution to any dispute between them concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement. In this regard, the Parties agree to engage in direct and meaningful negotiations to arrive at such solutions. If the Parties cannot reach an agreement within six months after the beginning of dispute between themselves through the foregoing procedure, the dispute may be submitted, upon the request of either Party, to an arbitral tribunal of three members.</p>
        <p>2. Within two months of receipt of a request, each Party shall appoint an arbitrator. The two arbitrators shall select a third arbitrator as Chairman, who is a national of a third State. In the event either Party fails to appoint an arbitrator within the specified time, the other Party may request the President of the International Court of Justice to make the appointment.</p>
        <p>3. If both arbitrators cannot reach an agreement about the choice of the Chairman within two months after their appointment, the Chairman shall be appointed upon the request of either Party by the President of the International Court of Justice.</p>
        <p>4.

The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decisions, which shall be final and binding, by a majority of votes.</p>
        <p>7. Expenses incurred by the Chairman, the other arbitrators, and other costs of the proceedings shall be paid for equally by the Parties. The tribunal may, however, at its discretion, decide that a higher proportion of the costs be paid by one of the Parties.</p>
        <p>8. A dispute shall not be submitted to an international arbitration court under the provisions of this Article, if the same dispute has been brought before another international arbitration court under the provisions of Article VII and is still before the court. This will not impair the engagement in direct and meaningful negotiations between both Parties.</p>

      <div type="article" num="IX" title="Application of other provisions">
        <p>If the laws of either Party or international agreements existing at present or established hereafter between the Parties or other international agreements whereof the Parties are signatories contain provisions entitling investments by investors of the other Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by this Agreement, such laws and agreements shall to the extent that they are more favourable prevail over this Agreement.</p>
