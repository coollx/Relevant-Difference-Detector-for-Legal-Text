        <p>2. Any change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect their character as investments.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion of investments">

        <p>2.

        <p>3. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investors of the other Contracting Party treatment not less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State.</p>
        <p>4. The provisions of paragraphs (2) and (3) shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to the investors of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from -</p>
        <p>(a) Any existing or future customs union, free trade area, common market, any similar international agreement or any interim arrangement leading up to such customs union, free trade area, or common market to which either of the Contracting Parties is or may become a party, or</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="Compensation of losses">
        <p>1. Investors of one Contracting Party whose investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party suffer losses owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency, revolt, insurrection or riot in the territory of the latter Contracting Party shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party treatment, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement, not less favourable than that which the latter Contracting Party accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State.</p>
        <p>2. Without derogating from the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article, investors of one Contracting Party who, in any of the situations referred to in that paragraph, suffer losses in the territory of the other Contracting Party resulting from:</p>
        <p>(a) Requisitioning of their property by the forces or authorities of the latter Contracting Party, or</p>
        <p>(b) Destruction of their property by the forces or authorities of the latter Contracting Party, which was not caused in combat action or was not required by the necessity of the situation,</p>
        <p>Shall be accorded restitution or adequate compensation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Expropriation">
        <p>1. Investments of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures having effects equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as "expropriation") in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for public purposes, under due process of law, on a non-discriminatory basis and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Interest at a normal commercial rate shall be paid for undue delay in paying such compensation.</p>
        <p>2. The investor affected by the expropriation shall have a right, under the law of the Contracting Party making the expropriation, to prompt review, by a court of law or other independent and impartial forum of that Contracting Party, of the legality of the expropriation and of the valuation of his or its investment in accordance with the principles referred to in paragraph (1).</p>
        <p>3. Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is incorporated or constituted under laws in force in any part of its territory, and in which investors of the other Contracting Party own shares, it shall ensure that the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article are applied to the extent necessary to guarantee compensation as specified therein to such investors of the other Contracting Party who are owners of those shares.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Transfers of investments and returns">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall allow investors of the other Contracting Party the free transfer of payment relating to their investments and returns, which shall include in particular, though not exclusively -</p>
        <p>(a) Profits, capital gains, dividends, royalties, interest, and other current income accruing from any investment;</p>
        <p>(b) The proceeds of the total or partial liquidation of any investment;</p>

        <p>2. All transfers shall be effected without undue delay in any convertible currency at the market rate of exchange applicable on the date of transfer.

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Settlement of disputes between an investor and a contracting party">
        <p>1. Any legal dispute between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party relating to an investment of the former which have not been amicably settled shall, after a period of six months from written notification of a claim, be submitted to international arbitration if the investor concerned so wishes.</p>
        <p>2. Where the dispute is referred to international arbitration, the investor and the Contracting Party concerned in the dispute may agree to refer the dispute either to:</p>
        <p>(a) The International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington DC on 18 March 1965, when each Contracting Party has become a party to said Convention;</p>
        <p>(As long as this requirement is not met, each Contracting Party agrees that the dispute may be settled under the rules governing the Additional Facility for the Administration of Proceedings by the Secretariat of ICSID) or</p>
        <p>(b) An international arbitrator or adhoc arbitration tribunal to be appointed by a special agreement or established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission of International Trade Law.</p>
        <p>3. If after a period of three months from written notification of the investor's decision to refer the dispute to international arbitration there is no agreement on one of the alternative procedures referred to in paragraph (2), the dispute shall, at the request in writing of the investor concerned, be dealt with in terms of the procedure preferred by the investor.</p>
        <p>4. The award made by the arbitrator concerned in terms of paragraphs 2 or 3 shall be binding on the parties to the dispute. Each Contracting Party shall give effect to the award under its national law.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1. Any dispute between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement should, if possible, be settled through negotiations between the Governments of the two Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>2. If the dispute cannot thus be settled within a period of six months, following the date on which such negotiations were requested by either Contracting Party, it shall upon the request of either Contracting Party be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>3. Such an arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way. Within two months of the receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the tribunal. Those two members shall then select a national of a third State who on approval by the two Contracting Parties shall be appointed Chairman of the tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>4. If within the periods specified in paragraph (3) of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make any necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he too is prevented from discharging the said function, the Member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be binding on both Contracting Parties. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings; the cost of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. The tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proprotion of costs shall be borne by one of the two Contracting Parties, and this award shall be binding on both Contracting Parties. The tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Subrogration">
        <p>If a Contracting Party or its designated Agency makes a payment to its own investor under a guarantee it has given in respect of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall recognise the assignment, whether by law or by legal transaction, to the former Contracting Party of all the rights and claims of the indemnified investor, and shall recognize that the former Contracting Party or this designated agency is entitled to exercise such rights and enforce such claims by virtue of subrogation, to the same extent as the original investor.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Application of other rules">
        <p>1. If the provisions of the law of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement contain rules, whether general or specific, entitling investments and returns of investors of the other Contracting Party to treatment more favourable than is provided for by the present Agreement, such rules shall to the extent that they are more favourable prevail over the present Agreement.</p>
        <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Scope of the agreement">
        <p>This agreement shall apply to all investments, whether made before or after the date of entry into force of this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="12" title="Final clauses">
        <p>1. The Contracting Parties shall notify each other when their respective constitutional requirements for entry into force of this Agreement have been fulfilled. The Agreement shall enter into force on the date of receipt of the last notification.</p>
        <p>2. This Agreement shall remain in force for a period of ten years. Thereafter it shall continue in force until the expiration of twelve months from the date on which either Contracting Party shall have given written notice of termination to the other.</p>
        <p>3. In respect of investments made prior to the date when the notice of termination becomes effective, the provisions of articles 1 to 11 remain in force with respect to such investments for a further period of twenty years from that date.</p>
