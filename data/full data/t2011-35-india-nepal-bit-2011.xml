      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2" title="Scope of the Agreement">
        <p>This Agreement shall apply to any investment by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party admitted in accordance with its laws and regulations, whether made before or after coming into force of this Agreement, but shall not apply to any dispute concerning an investment which arose, or any claim which was settled, before its entry into force.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Promotion and Protection of Investments">
        <p>(1)  Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create favourable condition for investors of the other Contracting Party to make investments in its territory, and admit such investments in accordance with its policies, laws and regulations.</p>
        <p>(2)  Investments and returns of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment in the territory of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="National Treatment and Most-favoured-nation Treatment">
        <p>(1)  Each Contracting Party shall accord to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, treatment which shall not be less favourable than that accorded either to investments of its own investors or investments of investors of any third State.</p>
        <p>(2)  In addition, each Contracting Party shall accord to investors of the other Contracting Party, including in respect of returns on their investments, treatment which shall not be less favourable than that accorded to investors of any third State.</p>
        <p>(3)  The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to the investors of the other the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from:</p>
        <p>(i)  any existing or future customs unions or similar international agreement to which it is or may become a party; or</p>
        <p>(ii)  any matter pertaining wholly or mainly to taxation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Expropriation">
        <p>(1)  Investments of investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall not be subjected to nationalisation, expropriation or any other measure having similar effects (hereinafter expropriation) except for reasons of public purpose in accordance with the law, on a non-discriminatory basis and against fair and equitable compensation.</p>
        <p>(2)  It is understood that:</p>
        <p>(a)  Indirect expropriation results from a measure or series of measures of a Contracting Party having an equivalent effect to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure;</p>
        <p>(b)  The determination of whether a measure or series of measures of a Contracting Party constitute indirect expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry considering among other factors:</p>
        <p>(i)  the economic impact of the measure or series of measures, however, the sole fact of a measure or series of measures having adverse effects on the economic value of an investment does not imply that an indirect expropriation has occurred;</p>
        <p>(ii)  the extent to which the measures are discriminatory either in scope or in application with respect to an investor or a company of a Party;</p>
        <p>(iii)  the extent to which the measure or series of measures interfere with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations concerning the investment;</p>
        <p>(iv) the character and intent of the measure or series of measures, whether they are for bona fide public interest purposes or not and whether there is a reasonable nexus between them, and the intention to expropriate.</p>
        <p>(c)  Non-discriminatory regulatory measures by a Contracting Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives including the protection of health, safety and environment do not constitute expropriation or nationalization; except in rare circumstances, where those measures are so severe that they cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith for achieving their objectives.</p>
        <p>(d)  Actions and awards by judicial bodies of a Contracting Party that are designed, applied or issued in public interest including those designed to address health, safety and environmental concerns, do not constitute expropriation or nationalization.</p>
        <p>(3)  The compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the investment expropriated, immediately before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, shall include interest at a commercially reasonable rate until the date of payment, shall be made without unreasonable delay, be effectively realizable and be freely transferable.</p>
        <p>(4)  The affected investor shall have the right to, in conformity with the laws of the Contracting Party that makes the expropriation, the prompt review, by a judicial or other independent authority of that Contracting Party, of its case, in order to decide if the expropriation and assessment of its investment have been adopted pursuant to the principles established in this Article.</p>
        <p>(5)  Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company that is constituted in its territory according to its laws in force and in which investors of the other Contracting Party participate, it shall ensure that the provisions of this Article are applied in such a way that it guarantees such investors a fair and equitable compensation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Compensation for Losses">
        <p>Investors of one Contracting Party whose investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party suffer losses owing to war or other armed conflict, a state of national emergency or insurrection or riots in the territory of the latter Contracting Party shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party, treatment, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement, no less favourable than that it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State. Resulting payments shall be freely transferable.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Repatriation of Investment and Returns">
        <p>(1)  Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with its laws, permit all funds of an investor of the other Contracting Party related to an investment in its territory to be freely transferred, without unreasonable delay and on a non-discriminatory basis. Such funds may include:</p>
        <p>(i)  Capital and additional capital amounts used to maintain and increase investments;</p>
        <p>(ii)  Net profits including dividends and interest in proportion to their share-holdings;</p>
        <p>(iii)  Repayments of any loan pursuant to a loan agreement including interest thereon, relating to the investment;</p>
        <p>(iv) Payment of royalties and services fees relating to the investment;</p>
        <p>(v)  Proceeds from sales of their shares;</p>
        <p>(vi) Proceeds received by investors in case of sale or partial sale or liquidation;</p>
        <p>(vii) The earnings of nationals of one Contracting Party who work in connection with investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>(2)  Nothing in paragraph (1) of this Article shall affect the transfer of any compensation under Article 6 of this Agreement.</p>
        <p>(3)  Unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting Parties, currency transfer under paragraph (1) of this Article shall be permitted in the currency of the original investment, or any other convertible currency mutually agreed upon between the Contracting Party and the investor. Such transfer shall be made at the prevailing market rate of exchange on the date of transfer.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Subrogation">
        <p>Where one Contracting Party or its designated agency has guaranteed any indemnity against non-commercial risks in respect of an investment by any of its investors in the territory of the other Contracting Party and has made payment to such investors in respect of their claims under this Agreement, the other Contracting Party agrees that the first Contracting Party or its designated agency is entitled by virtue of subrogation to exercise the rights and assert the claims of those investors. The subrogated rights or claims shall not exceed the original rights or claims of such investors.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and a Contracting Party">
        <p>(1)  Any dispute between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party in relation to an investment of the former under this Agreement shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably through negotiations between the parties to the dispute.</p>
        <p>(2)  Any such dispute which has not been amicably settled within a period of six months may, if both parties agree, be submitted:</p>
        <p>(i)  for resolution, in accordance with the law of the Contracting Party which has admitted the investment to that Contracting Partys competent judicial, arbitral or administrative bodies; or</p>
        <p>(ii)  to international conciliation under the Conciliation Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law.</p>
        <p>(3)  Should the parties fail to agree on a dispute settlement procedure provided under paragraph (2) of this Article or where a dispute is referred to conciliation but conciliation proceedings are terminated other than by signing of a settlement agreement, the dispute may be referred to Arbitration. The Arbitration procedure shall be as follows:</p>
        <p>(i)  If the Contracting Party of the Investor and the other Contracting Party are both parties to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, 1965 and both parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit the dispute to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes such a dispute shall be referred to the Centre; or</p>
        <p>(ii)  If both parties to the dispute so agree, under the Additional Facility for the Administration of Conciliation, Arbitration and Fact-Finding proceedings; or</p>

        <p>(b)  The parties shall appoint their respective arbitrators within two months;</p>

        <p>(d)  The arbitral tribunal shall state the basis of its decision and give reasons upon the request of either party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Disputes between the Contracting Parties">
        <p>(1)  Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall, as far as possible, be settled through negotiations.</p>
        <p>(2)  If a dispute between the Contracting Parties cannot thus be settled within six months from the time the dispute arose, it shall upon the request of either Contracting party be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>(3)  Such an arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way.

The Chairman shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>(4)  If within the periods specified in paragraph (3) of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make any necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice President is a national of either Contracting party or if he too is prevented from discharging the said function, the Member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>(5)  The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decisions shall be binding on both Contracting Parties.
