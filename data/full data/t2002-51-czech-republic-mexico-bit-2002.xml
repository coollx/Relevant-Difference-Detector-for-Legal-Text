      <p>Ad Article 2, paragraph (3)</p>
      <p>1) Article 2, paragraph (3) prescribes the customary International Law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of investors of another Contracting Party.</p>
      <p>2) The concepts of "fair and equitable treatment" and "full protection and security" do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary International Law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.</p>
      <p>3) A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of the Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of the provisions established in Article 2, paragraph (3) of this Agreement.</p>
      <p>Ad. Article 3, paragraph (3) (a)</p>
      <p>Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent either Contracting Party from applying new measures adopted within the framework of one of the forms of regional co-operation referred to in paragraph (3) (a) of this Article, which replace the measures previously applied by that Contracting Party, in a manner that is not inconsistent with this Agreement.</p>
      <p>DONE at Mexico City, in the fourth of April of two thousand and two, in duplicate, in the Czech, Spanish and English languages, being all texts equally authentic. In case of divergence of interpretation the English text shall prevail.</p>
