        <p>Within two months of receipt of a request, each Contracting Party shall appoint an arbitrator.

A dispute shall not be submitted to an international arbitration court under the provisions of this Article, if the same dispute has been brought before another international arbitration court under the provisions of Article 10 and is still in the court.
