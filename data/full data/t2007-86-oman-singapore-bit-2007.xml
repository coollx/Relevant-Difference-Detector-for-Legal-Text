        <p>4.  if the tribunal shall not have been constituted within four months of receipt of the request for arbitration, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is unable to do so, the Vice-President may be invited to do so. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is unable to do so, the Member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party may be invited to make the necessary appointments, and so on.</p>
        <p>5.  In deciding a dispute, the tribunal shall take into account the provisions of this Agreement and the principles of international law.</p>
        <p>6.  The tribunal shall reach its decisions by a majority of votes and these decisions shall be final and legally binding upon the Contracting Parties who shall comply with the terms of its award. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own member and of its representation in the arbitration proceedings; the cost of the Chairman shall be borne in equal shares by</p>
        <p>Both Contracting Parties. The tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the two Parties, and this award shall be binding on both Parties. The tribunal shall interpret its decisions at the request of either Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>7.  Apart from the above the tribunal shall establish its own rules of procedure.</p>

        <p>2.  Investments having formed the subject of a special commitment of one Contracting Party, with respect to the investors of the other Contracting Party, shall be governed, without prejudice to the provisions of this Agreement, by the terms of the said commitment if the latter includes provisions more favourable than those of this Agreement.</p>
