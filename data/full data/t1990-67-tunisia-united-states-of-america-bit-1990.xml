      <p>Having resolved to conclude a Treaty concerning the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investment,</p>
      <p>Have agreed as follows:</p>
    </preamble>
    <body>
      <div type="article" num="1">
        <p>1. For the purposes of this Treaty,</p>
        <p>(a) "investment' means every kind of investment, in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes:</p>

        <p>(ii) A company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof;</p>
        <p>(iii) A claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value, and associated with an investment;</p>
        <p>(iv) Intellectual and industrial property rights, including rights with respect to copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade names, industrial designs, trade secrets and know-how, and goodwill; and</p>
        <p>(v) Any right conferred by law or contract, and any licenses and permits pursuant to law;</p>
        <p>(b) "national" of a Party means:</p>
        <p>(i) With respect to Tunisia: natural persons of Tunisian nationality in accordance with Tunisian law;</p>

        <p>(c) "company of a Party" means any kind of corporation, company, association, or other organization, legally constituted under the laws and regulations of a Party or a political subdivision thereof whether or not organized for pecuniary gain, or privately or governmentally owned;</p>

        <p>2.

      <div type="article" num="2">
        <p>1. Each Party shall permit in its territory investments, and activities associated therewith, by nationals and companies of the other Party on a basis no less favorable than that accorded in like situations to investments of nationals or companies of any other country and, within the framework of its existing laws and regulations, no less favorable than that accorded in like situations to investments of its own nationals and companies.</p>
        <p>2. Each Party shall accord to these investments, once established, and associated activities, treatment not less favorable than that accorded in like situations to investments of its own nationals and companies or to investments of nationals and companies of any third country, whichever is the most favorable.</p>
        <p>3. Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.

        <p>5. Without prejudice to the right of either Party to prescribe fair procedures in connection with the employment of top managerial personnel, companies which are legally constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of one Party, and which are investments, shall be permitted to engage such personnel of their choice, regardless of nationality.</p>

        <p>10. The most favored nation provisions of this Article shall not apply to advantages accorded by either Party to nationals or companies of any third country by virtue of that Party's binding obligations that derive from full membership in a regional customs union or free trade area.</p>

A national or company of either Party that asserts that all or part of its investment has been expropriated shall have a right to prompt review by the appropriate judicial or administrative authorities of the other Party to determine whether any such expropriation has occurred and, if so, whether such expropriation, and any compensation therefor, conforms to the principles of international law.</p>
        <p>3. Nationals or companies of either Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Party owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency, insurrection, civil disturbance or other similar events shall be accorded treatment by such other Party no less favorable than that accorded to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third country, whichever is the most favorable treatment, as regards any measures it adopts in relation to such losses.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4">
        <p>1. Each Party shall, with respect to investment by nationals or companies of the other Party, permit the free and prompt transfer, related to such investment, of: (a) returns; (b) compensation pursuant to Article III; (c) payments arising out of an investment dispute; (d) payments made under a contract, including amortization of principal and accrued interest payments made pursuant to a loan agreement; (e) proceeds from the sale or liquidation of all or any part of an investment; and (f) additional contributions to capital for the maintenance or development of an investment.</p>

        <p>3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, either Party may maintain laws and regulations (a) requiring reports of currency transfer and (b) imposing income taxes by such means as a withholding tax applicable to dividends or other transfers. Furthermore, either Party may protect the rights of creditors, or ensure the satisfaction of judgments in adjudicatory proceedings, through the equitable and nondiscriminatory application of its law.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5">

Prompt transfer of the compensation at the rate of exchange used for commercial purposes on the date of expropriation shall be guaranteed in order to maintain the value of the compensation.</p>

With respect to Article VI, if the Government of Tunisia (or any of its competent agencies) makes payment to any of its nationals or companies under an indemnity or a guarantee it has granted with respect to an investment or any part thereof in the territory of the United States, and therefore has become subrogated to any of the rights of such nationals or companies with respect to such investment, the United States shall recognize (a) such rights of the Government of Tunisia (or its competent agency), and that the Government of Tunisia (or its competent agency) in entitled by virtue of subrogation to enforce such rights.</p>
