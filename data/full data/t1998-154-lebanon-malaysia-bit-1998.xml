        <p>(a) "investments" means every kind of asset and in particular, though not exclusively, includes:</p>
        <p>(i) Movable and immovable property and any other rights in rem, such as mortgages, liens or pledges;</p>

        <p>(b) Any alteration of the form in which assets are invested shall not affect their classification as investments, provided that such alteration is not contrary to the approval, if any, granted in respect of the assets originally invested.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion and protection of investments">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create favourable conditions for investors of the other Contracting Party to invest capital in its territory and, in accordance with its laws and regulations shall admit such investments.</p>
        <p>2. Investments of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded equitable treatment and shall enjoy full and adequate protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Most-favoured-nation provisions">
        <p>1. Investments made by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall receive treatment which is fair and equitable, and not less favourable than that accorded to investments made by investors of any third State.</p>
        <p>The provisions of this Agreement relative to the granting of treatment not less favourable than that accorded to the investors of any third State shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to the investors of the other the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from:</p>
        <p>(a) Any existing or future customs union or free trade area or a common market or a monetary union or similar international agreement or other forms of regional cooperation to which either of the Contracting Parties is or may become a party; or the adoption of an agreement designed to lead to the formation or extension of such a union or area within a reasonable length of time; or</p>

        <p>Investors of one Contracting Party whose investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party suffer losses owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency, revolt, insurrection or riot in the territory of the latter Contracting Party shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party treatment, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement, no less favourable than that which the latter Contracting Party accords to investors of any third State.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Expropriation">
        <p>Neither Contracting Party shall take any measures of expropriation or nationalization against the investments of an investor of the other Contracting Party except under the following conditions:</p>

        <p>(b) The measures are non-discriminatory;</p>
        <p>(c) The measures are accompanied by provisions for the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the investments affected immediately before the measure of dispossession became public knowledge, and it shall be freely transferable in freely usable currencies from the Contracting Party. Any delay in payment of compensation shall carry an interest at prevailing commercial rate unless such rate is prescribed by law.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Transfers">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall, subject to its laws and regulations allow without unreasonable delay the transfer in any freely usable currency:</p>

        <p>2. The exchange rates applicable to such transfer in the paragraph 1 of this Article shall be the rate prevailing in the foreign exchange market at the time of remittance.</p>
        <p>3. The Contracting Parties undertake to accord to the transfers referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article a treatment as favourable as that accorded to transfer originating from investments made by investors of any third State.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Settlement of investment disputes between a contracting party and an investor of the other contracting party">
        <p>1. Any dispute arising between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party which involves;</p>
        <p>(i) An obligation entered into by that Contracting Party with the investor of the other Contracting Party regarding an investment by such investor; or</p>
        <p>(ii) An alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Agreement with respect to an investment by such investor;</p>
        <p>shall be settled amicably between the parties through consultation and negotiation. 2. If the dispute referred to in paragraph 1 cannot be resolved within six (6) months from the date on which the matter was raised by either party, it may, at the request of either party, be referred to;</p>
        <p>(i) The courts of justice or administrative tribunals or agencies of competent jurisdiction of the Contracting Party that is a party to the dispute;</p>
        <p>(ii) The International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) having regard to the applicable provisions of the Convention on the settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of the other states opened for signature at Washington D.C on 18 March 1965; or</p>
        <p>(iii) An International Arbitral Tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). The Parties to the dispute may agree in writing to modify the rules.</p>
        <p>3. The choice made as per subparagraphs i, ii, and iii herein above is final.</p>
        <p>4. The arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the applicable rules and principles of International law. The awards of arbitration shall be final and binding on both parties to the dispute. Each Contracting Party shall carry out without delay any such award and such award shall be enforced in accordance with domestic law.</p>
        <p>5. Neither Contracting Party shall pursue through diplomatic channels any matter referred to arbitration until the proceedings have terminated or a Contracting Party has failed to abide by or comply with the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Settlement of disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1. Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement should, if possible, be settled through diplomatic channels.</p>
        <p>2. If a dispute between the Contracting Parties cannot thus be settled, it shall upon the request of either Contracting Party be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>3. Such an arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way. Within two months of the receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the tribunal. Those two members shall then select a national of a third State who on approval by the two Contracting Parties shall be appointed Chairman of the tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within two (2) months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>4. If within the periods specified in paragraph 3 of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he too is prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be binding on both Contracting Parties. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings; the cost of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. The tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the two Contracting Parties, and this award shall be binding on both Contracting Parties. The tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If a Contracting Party or its designated agency makes a payment to any of its investors under a guarantee it has granted in respect of an investment, the other Contracting Party shall, without prejudice to the rights of the former Contracting Party under Article 7, recognize the transfer of any right or title of such investors to the former Contracting Party or its designated agency and the subrogation of the former Contracting Party or its designated agency to any right or title. The latter Contracting party shall also recognize the subrogation of the former Contracting Party to any right or claim which that Contracting Party shall be entitled to assert to the same extent as its predecessor in title. The other Contracting Party shall be entitled to set off taxes and other public charges due and payable by the investor.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Application to investments">
        <p>This Agreement shall apply to investments made in the territory of either Contracting Party in accordance with its laws or regulations by investors of the other Contracting Party prior to as well as after the entry into force of this Agreement. However the Agreement shall not apply to disputes that have arisen before its entry into force.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Amendment">
        <p>This Agreement may be amended by mutual consent of both Contracting Parties at any time after it is in force. Any alteration or modification of this Agreement shall be done without prejudice to the rights and obligations arising from this agreement prior to the date of such alteration or modification until such rights and obligations are fully implemented.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="12" title="Entry into force, duration and termination">
        <p>1. This Agreement shall enter into force thirty (30) days after the later date on which the Governments of the Contracting Parties have notified each other that their constitutional requirements for the entry into force of this Agreement have been fulfilled. The later date shall refer to the date on which the last notification letter is sent.</p>
        <p>2. This Agreement shall remain in force for a period of ten (10) years, and shall continue in force, unless terminated in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article.</p>
        <p>3. Either Contracting Party may by giving one (1) year's written notice to the other Contracting Party, terminate this Agreement at the end of the initial ten (10) year-period or anytime thereafter.</p>
        <p>4. With respect to investments made or acquired prior to the date of termination of this Agreement, the provisions of all of the other Articles of this Agreement shall continue to be effective for a period of ten (10) years from such date of termination.</p>
