    <body>
      <div type="article" num="1" title="Definitions">
        <p>For the purpose of this Agreement:</p>
        <p>1-&nbsp; The term "investor" refers with regard to either Contracting Party to:</p>
        <p>a) Natural persons who, according to the law of that Contracting Party, are considered to be its citizens;</p>
        <p>b) Legal entities, including companies, corporations, business associations and other organizations, which are constituted or otherwise duly organized under the law of that Contracting Party and have their seat, together with real economic activities in the territory of that same Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of this sub-paragraph this Agreement applies to holding or offshore Companies registered in any of the Contracting Parties. 2-&nbsp; The term "investments" shall include every kind of assets and particularly, but not exclusively:</p>
        <p>a) Movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem, such as mortgages, and pledges;</p>
        <p>b) Shares, parts or any other kind of participation in companies;</p>
        <p>c) Claims to money or to any rights to any performance having an economic value;</p>
        <p>d) Intellectual property rights, such as copyrights, patents, industrial designs or models, trade or service marks, trade names, know-how and goodwill, as well as other similar rights recognized by the laws of the Contracting Parties;</p>
        <p>e) Concessions under public law, including concessions to search, extract or exploit natural resources as well as all other rights given by law, by contract or by decision of the authority in accordance with the law.</p>
        <p>Any alteration of the form in which assets are invested or reinvested shall not affect their character as investment. 3-&nbsp; The term "returns" means amounts yielded by an investment and in particular, though not exclusively, includes profits, dividends, interests, capital gain, royalties, management and technical assistance or other fees, irrespective of the form in which the return is paid.</p>
        <p>4-&nbsp; The term "territory" means the territory of the Contracting Parties, including the territorial sea and the economic exclusive zone over which the State concerned exercises, in accordance with internal and international law, sovereignty sovereign rights and jurisdiction.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion, Admission">
        <p>1-&nbsp; Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote as far as possible investments by investors of the other Contracting Party and admit such investments in accordance with its laws and regulations.</p>
        <p>2-&nbsp; When a Contracting Party shall have admitted an investment on its territory, it shall, in accordance with its laws and regulations, grant the necessary permits in connection with such an investment, including authorizations for engaging top managerial and technical personnel of their choice, regardless of nationality.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Protection, Treatment">
        <p>1-&nbsp; Each Contracting Party shall protect within its territory investments made in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, sale or liquidation of such investments, In particular, each Contracting Party or its competent authorities shall issue the necessary authorizations mentioned in Article 2, paragraph 2, of this Agreement.</p>
        <p>2-&nbsp; Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment within its territory of the investments of the investors of the other Contracting Party. This treatment shall not be less favourable than that granted by each Contracting Party to the investments made within its territory by its own investors, or than that granted by each Contracting Party to the investments made within its territory by investors of any third state, if this latter treatment is more favourable. However, in case of Lebanon this sub-paragraph does not apply to treatment granted to investors of other Arab Countries.</p>
        <p>3-&nbsp; The most favoured nation treatment shall not be construed so as to oblige a Contracting Party to extend to the investors and investments of the other Contracting Party the advantages resulting from any existing or future customs or economic union, a free trade area or regional economic organization, to which either of the Contracting Parties is or becomes a member. Nor shall such, treatment relate to any advantage which either Contracting Party accords to investors of a third state by virtue of a double taxation agreement or other agreements on a reciprocal basis regarding tax matters.</p>

        <p>b) Amounts relating to loans incurred, or other contractual obligations undertaken, for the investment; and</p>
        <p>c) Proceeds accruing form the total or partial sale, alienation or liquidation of an investment.</p>
        <p>2-&nbsp; Unless otherwise agreed with the investor transfers shall be made, pursuant to the laws and regulations in force of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made, at market rate of exchange applicable by the banks on the date of transfer.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="5" title="Dispossession, Compensation">

The amount of compensation and interest included shall be settled in a convertible currency and paid without delay to the investor entitled thereto. Resulting payments shall be freely and promptly transferable.</p>

      </div>

        <p>2-&nbsp; Each Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation it has assumed with regard to investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Principle of Subrogation">
        <p>If either Contracting Party or its designated agency makes payment to one of its investors under any financial guarantee against non-commercial risks it has granted in regard of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter shall recognize, by virtue of the principle of subrogation, the assignment of any right of title of that investor to the first Contracting Party or its designated agency.
