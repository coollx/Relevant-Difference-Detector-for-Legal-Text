      <div type="article" num="2" title="Scope and general provisions">
        <p>2.1 This Treaty shalt apply to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to investments of investors of another Party in its territory, in existence as of the date of entry into force of this Treaty or established, acquired, or expanded thereafter, and which have been admitted by a Party in accordance with its law, regulations and policies as applicable from time to time. </p>
        <p>2.2 Subject to the provisions of Chapter III of this Treaty, nothing in this Treaty shall extend to any Pre-investment activity related to establishment, acquisition or expansion of any investment, or to any measure related to such Pre-investment activities, including terms and conditions under such measure which continue to apply post-investment to the management, conduct, operation, sale or other disposition of such investments. </p>
        <p>2.3 This Treaty shall not apply to claims arising out of events which occurred, or claims which have been raised prior to the entry into force of this Treaty. </p>
        <p>This Treaty shall not apply to: </p>
        <p>(i) any measure by a local government; </p>
        <p>(ii) any law or measure regarding taxation, including measures taken to enforce taxation obligations. </p>
        <p>For greater certainty, it is clarified that where the State in which investment is made decides that conduct alleged to be a breach of its obligations under this Treaty is a subject matter of taxation, such decision of that State, whether before or after the commencement of arbitral proceedings, shall be non-justiciable and it shall not be open to any arbitration tribunal to review such decision. </p>
        <p>(iii) the issuance of compulsory licenses granted in relation to intellectual property rights, or to the revocation, limitation or creation of intellectual property rights, to the extent that such issuance, revocation, limitation or creation is consistent with the international obligations of Parties under the WTO Agreement. </p>
        <p>(iv) government procurement by a Party; </p>
        <p>(v) subsidies or grants provided by a Party; </p>
        <p>(vi) services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority by the relevant body or authority of a Party. For the purposes of this provision, a service supplied in the exercise of governmental authority means any service which is not supplied on a commercial basis. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="chapter" num="II" title="Obligations of parties">
        <div type="article" num="3" title="Treatment of investments">
          <p>3.1 No Party shall subject investments made by investors of the other Party to measures which constitute a violation of customary international law (1) through: </p>
          <p>(i) Denial of justice in any judicial or administrative proceedings; or </p>
          <p>(ii) fundamental breach of due process; or </p>
          <p>(iii) targeted discrimination on manifestly unjustified grounds, such as gender, race or religious belief; or </p>
          <p>(iv) manifestly abusive treatment, such as coercion, duress and harassment. </p>
          <p>3.2 Each Party shall accord in its territory to investments of the other Party and to investors with respect to their investments full protection and security. For greater certainty, "full protection and security" only refers to a Party's obligations relating to physical security of investors which means ensuring foreign investors and their investments same level of physical security as provided to domestic investors and their investments and not to any other obligation whatsoever. </p>
          <p>3.3 A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of this Treaty, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of this Article. </p>
          <p>3.4 In considering an alleged breach of this article, a Tribunal shall take account of whether the investor or, as appropriate, the locally-established enterprise, pursued action for remedies before domestic courts or tribunals prior to initiating a claim under this Treaty.</p>
          <div type="foot_note">(1) For greater certainty, it is clarified that "customary international law" only results from a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation.</div>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="4" title="National treatment">
          <p>4.1 Each Party shall not apply to investor or to investments made by investors of- the other Party, measures that, accord less favourable treatment than that it accords, in like circumstances (2), to its own investors or to investments by such investors with respect to the management, conduct, operation, sale or other disposition of investments in its territory. </p>
          <p>4.2 The treatment accorded by a Party under Article 4.1 means, with respect to a Sub-national government, treatment no less favourable than the treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that Sub-national government to investors, and to investments of investors, of the Party of which it forms a part. </p>
          <div type="foot_note">(2)&nbsp;For greater certainty, whether treatment is accorded in "like circumstances" depends on the totality of the circumstances, including whether the relevant treatment distinguishes between investors or investments on the basis of legitimate regulatory objectives. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, (a) the goods or services consumed or produced by the investment; (b) the actual and potential impact of the investment on third persons, the local community, or the environment, (c) whether the investment is public, private, or state-owned or controlled, and (d) the practical challenges of regulating the investment.</div>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="5" title="Expropriation">
          <p>5.1 Neither Party may nationalize or expropriate an investment of an investor (hereinafter "<b>expropriate</b>") of the other Party either directly or through measures having an effect equivalent to expropriation, except for reasons of public purpose (3), in accordance with the due process of law and on payment of adequate compensation. Such compensation shall be adequate and be at least equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately on the day before the expropriation takes place ("<b>date of expropriation</b>"), and shall not reflect any change in value occurring because the intended expropriation had become known earlier. Valuation criteria shall include going concern value, asset value including declared tax value of tangible property, and other criteria, as appropriate, to determine fair market value. </p>
          <p>5.2 Payment of compensation shall be made in a freely convertible currency. Interest on payment of compensation, where applicable, shall be paid in simple interest at a commercially reasonable rate from the date of expropriation until the date of actual payment. On payment, compensation shall be freely transferable in accordance with Article 6. </p>
          <p>5.3. The Parties confirm their shared understanding that: </p>
          <p>a) Expropriation may be direct or indirect: </p>
          <p>(i) direct expropriation occurs when an investment is nationalised or otherwise directly expropriated through formal transfer of title or outright seizure; and </p>
          <p>(ii) indirect expropriation occurs if a measure or series of measures of a Party has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation, in that it substantially or permanently deprives the investor of the fundamental attributes of property in its investment, including the right to use, enjoy and dispose of its&#x9D; investment, without formal transfer of title or outright seizure. </p>
          <p>b) The determination of whether a measure or a series of measures have an effect equivalent to expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry, that takes into consideration: </p>
          <p>(i) the economic impact of the measure or series of measures, although the sole fact that a measure or series of measures of a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred; </p>
          <p>(ii) the duration of the measure or series of measures of a Party; </p>
          <p>(iii) the character of the measure or series of measures, notably their object, context and intent; and </p>
          <p>(iv) whether a measure by a Party breaches the Party's prior binding written commitment to the investor whether by contract, licence or other legal document. </p>
          <p>5.4 For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that an action taken by a Party in its commercial capacity shall not constitute expropriation or any other measure having similar effect. </p>
          <p>5.5 Non-discriminatory regulatory measures by a Party or measures or awards by judicial bodies of a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public interest or public purpose objectives such as public health, safety and the environment shall not constitute expropriation under this Article. </p>
          <p>5.6 In considering an alleged breach of this Article, a Tribunal shall take account of whether the investor or, as appropriate, the locally-established enterprise, pursued action for remedies before domestic courts or tribunals prior to initiating a claim under this Treaty.</p>
          <div type="foot_note">(3) For the avoidance of doubt, where India is the expropriating Party, any measure of expropriation relating to land shall be for the purposes as set out in its Law relating to land acquisition and any questions as to "public purpose" and compensation shall be determined in accordance with the procedure specified in such Law.</div>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="6" title="Transfers">
          <p>6.1 Subject to its law, each Party shall permit all funds of an investor of the other Party related to an investment in its territory to be freely transferred and on a non-discriminatory basis. Such funds may include: </p>
          <p>(i) contributions to capital; </p>
          <p>(ii) profits, dividends, capital gains and proceeds from the sale of all or any part of the investment or from the partial or complete liquidation of the investment; </p>
          <p>(iii) interest, royalty payments, management fees, and technical assistance and other fees; </p>
          <p>(iv)payments made under a contract, including a loan agreement; </p>
          <p>(v) payments made pursuant to Article 5 [Expropriation], Article 7[Compensation for losses] and under Chapter IV. </p>
          <p>6.2 Unless otherwise agreed to between the Parties, currency transfer under Article 6.1&nbsp;shall be permitted in the currency of the original investment or any other convertible currency. Such transfer shall be made at the prevailing market rate of exchange on the date of transfer. </p>
          <p>6.3 Nothing in this Treaty shall prevent a Party from conditioning or preventing a transfer through a good faith application of its law, including actions relating to: </p>
          <p>i. bankruptcy, insolvency or the protection of the rights of the creditors; </p>
          <p>ii. compliance with judicial, arbitral or administrative decisions and awards; </p>
          <p>iii. compliance with labour obligations; </p>
          <p>iv. financial reporting or record keeping of transfers when necessary to assist law enforcement or financial regulatory authorities; </p>

          <p>ix. severance entitlements of employees; </p>
          <p>x. requirement to register and satisfy other formalities imposed by the Central Bank and other relevant authorities of a Party; and </p>
          <p>xi. in the case of India, requirements to lock-in initial capital investments, as provided in India's Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Policy, where applicable, provided that, any new measure which would require a lock-in period for investments will not apply to existing investments. </p>
          <p>6.4 Notwithstanding anything in Article 6.1 and 6.2 to the contrary, the Parties may temporarily restrict transfers in the event of serious balance-of-payments difficulties or threat thereof, or in cases where, in exceptional circumstances, movements of capital cause or threaten to cause serious difficulties for macroeconomic management, in particular, monetary and exchange rate policies. </p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="7" title="Compensation for losses">
          <p>Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party, and to investments by such investors, non-discriminatory treatment with respect to measures, including restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement, it adopts or maintains relating to losses suffered by investments in its territory owing to war or other armed conflict, civil strife, state of national emergency or a natural disaster.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="8" title="Subrogation">
          <p>8.1 If a Party or its designated agency makes a payment to a&#x43F;&#x443; of its investors under a guarantee or a contract of insurance it has entered into in respect of an investment, the other Party shall recognize the validity of the subrogation in&nbsp;favour of such Party or agency thereof to any right or title held by the investor.</p>
          <p>8.2 A Party or its designated agency thereof which is subrogated to the rights of an&nbsp;investor in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article shall be entitled in all&nbsp;circumstances to the same rights as those of the investor in respect of the&nbsp;investment. Such rights may be exercised by the Party or its designated agency&nbsp;thereof, or by the investor if the Party or any agency thereof so authorizes.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article" num="9" title="Entry and sojourn of personnel">
          <p>9.1 Subject to its law relating to the entry and sojourn of non-citizens and on the&nbsp;basis of reciprocity, each Party shall permit natural persons of the other Party&nbsp;employed by the investor or the locally established enterprise to enter and&nbsp;remain in its territory for the purpose of engaging in activities connected with&nbsp;the investment.</p>

          <p>(iii) the disputing investor or the locally established enterprise have waived their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the Defending Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 13.2. </p>
          <p>(iv) where the claim submitted by the disputing investor is for loss or damage to an interest in an enterprise of the other Party that is a juridical person that the&nbsp;disputing investor owns or controls, that enterprise has waived its right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the Defending Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 13.2. </p>
          <p>(v) At least 90 days before submitting any claim to arbitration, the disputing investor has transmitted to the Defending Party a written notice of its intention to submit the claim to arbitration ("notice of arbitration"). The notice of arbitration shall: </p>
