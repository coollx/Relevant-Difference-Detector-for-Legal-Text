        <p>The treatment granted under this Agreement shall not apply to tax matters.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Promotion and admission of investments">

        <p>2. When a Contracting Party shall have admitted an investment in its territory, it shall, in accordance with its laws and regulations, grant the necessary permits in connection with such an investment and with the carrying out of licensing agreements and contracts for technical, commercial or administrative assistance.</p>
        <p>3. Each Contracting Party shall, whenever needed with respect to any admitted investment, endeavour to issue the necessary authorizations concerning the activities of consultants and other qualified persons, regardless of their nationality.</p>

        <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall accord, in its territory, to investors of the other Contracting Party, as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investment, treatment no less favourable than that which it accords to its own Investors or to investors of any third State whichever is more favourable to the investor concerned.</p>
        <p>3. The treatment granted under paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to the investors of the other Contracting Party and their investments the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from its membership of, or association with, any existing or future free trade area, customs union, economic union, monetary union or other regional economic integration organisation.</p>
        <p>4. Measures that have to be taken for reasons of public security and order or public health shall not be deemed treatment "less favourable" within the meaning of this Article.</p>

        <p>2. Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation or impending expropriation became publicly known, whichever is the earlier (hereinafter referred to as the "valuation date").</p>
        <p>3. Such fair market value shall be calculated in a freely convertible currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing for that currency on the valuation date.

Compensation shall be paid without delay, be effectively realizable and freely transferable.</p>
        <p>4.

        <p>5. Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its own territory, and in which investors of the other Contracting Party own shares, it shall ensure that the provisions of this Article are applied so as to guarantee prompt, adequate and effective compensation in respect of their investment to such investors of the other Contracting Party who are owners of those shares.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Compensation for losses">
        <p>1. Investors of one Contracting Party whose investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party suffer losses owing to war or to other armed conflict, state of national emergency, revolution, insurrection, civil disturbance or any other similar event, shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement, treatment no less favourable than that which the latter Contracting Party accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State whichever is more favourable to the investor concerned. Resulting payments shall be freely transferable.</p>
        <p>2. Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an investor of one Contracting Party who, in any of the situations referred to in that paragraph, suffers a loss in the territory of the other Contracting Party resulting from:</p>
        <p>a) Requisitioning of its investment or part thereof by the latter's forces or authorities; or</p>
        <p>b) Destruction of its investment or part thereof by the latter's forces or authorities, which was not required by the necessity of the situation,</p>

        <p>1. If the legislation of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to this Agreement contain a regulation, whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than that provided for by this Agreement, such regulation shall, to the extent that it is more favourable, prevail over this Agreement.</p>
        <p>2. More favourable terms than those of this Agreement which have been agreed to by one of the Contracting Parties with investors of the other Contracting Party shall not be affected by this Agreement.</p>
        <p>3. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the provisions established by international Agreements relating to the intellectual and industrial property rights in force at the date of its signature.</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Settlement of disputes between the contracting parties">
