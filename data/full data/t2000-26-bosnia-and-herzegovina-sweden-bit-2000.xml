      <div type="article" num="2" title="Promotion and protection of investments">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall, subject to its general policy in the field of foreign investment, encourage and create favourable, stable and transparent conditions for investors of the other Contracting Party to make investments in its territory and, shall admit such investments in accordance with its legislation.</p>
        <p>2. Investments of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the expansion, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments nor the acquisition of goods and services or the sale of their production, in its territory of investors of the other Contracting Party. In no case the Contracting Party shall award treatment less favourable than that required by international law. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it has entered into with the investors of the other Contracting Party with regard to their investments.</p>
        <p>3. Returns yielded from an investment shall be given the same treatment and protection as an investment.</p>
        <p>4.

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="National treatment and most-favoured-nation treatment">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investments and returns of investors of the other Contracting Party treatment which is no less favourable than that which it accords to investments and returns of its own investors or to investments and returns of investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable.</p>
        <p>2. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investors of the other Contracting Party, as regards the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments, treatment no less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable.</p>
        <p>3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to investors of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from:</p>
        <p>a) The membership of or association with any existing or future free trade area, customs union, economic union or common market to which the Contracting Party is or may become a party;</p>
        <p>b) Any international agreement or arrangement or domestic legislation, completely or partially related to taxation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="4" title="Nationalisation and expropriation">
        <p>1. Investments of investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to requisition or to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as "expropriation") except for a public purpose related to the internal needs and under due process of law, on a non-discriminatory basis and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation.</p>
        <p>2. Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the investments affected immediately before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation became publicly known in such a way as to effect the value of the investment (hereinafter referred to as the "Valuation Date"), whichever is the earlier. Such fair market value shall at the request of the investor be expressed in a freely convertible currency on the basis of the market rate of exchange existing for that currency on the Valuation Date. The compensation shall include interest at a commercial rate established on a market basis from the date of expropriation until the date of payment. The compensation shall be paid in a freely convertible currency and made transferable without delay, to the country designated by the claimants concerned.</p>
        <p>3. The affected investors of either Contracting Party shall have a right, under the law of the Contracting Party making the expropriation, to prompt review, by a judicial or other independent authority of that Party, concerning the legality of the expropriation, its process and the valuation of the investment in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.</p>
        <p>4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall also apply to the returns from an investment as well as, in the event of liquidation, to the proceeds from the liquidation.</p>
        <p>5. Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company or an enterprise in its territory in which investors of the other Contracting Party have an investment, including through the ownership of shares, it shall ensure that the provisions of this Article are applied to the extent necessary to guarantee prompt, adequate and effective compensation in respect of their investment to such investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>

        <p>2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1 of this Article, investors of one Contracting Party who in any of the situations referred to in that paragraph, suffer losses in the territory of the other Contracting Party resulting from:</p>
        <p>a) Requisitioning of its investment or part thereof by the latter's forces or authorities; or</p>
        <p>b) Destruction of its investment or part thereof by the latter's forces or authorities, which were not required by the necessity of the situation,</p>
        <p>Shall be accorded restitution or compensation which in either case shall be prompt, adequate and effective. Resulting payments shall be transferable without delay in a freely convertible currency.</p>

        <p>2. Transfers shall be effected without delay in a convertible currency at the market rate of exchange existing on the date of transfer with respect to spot transactions in the currency to be transferred. In the absence of a market for foreign exchange, the rate to be used will be the most recent rate applied to inward investments or the most recent exchange rate for conversion of currencies into Special Drawing Rights, whichever is the most favourable to the investor.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If either Contracting Party or its designated agency makes a payment to any of its investors under a guarantee it has assumed in respect of an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall, without prejudice to the rights of the former Contracting Party under Article 10, recognise the assignment, whether under a law or pursuant to a legal transaction, of any right or claim of such investor to the former Contracting Party or its agency.

        <p>7. Any arbitral award rendered pursuant to this Article shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute. Each Contracting Party shall carry out without delay the provisions of any such award and provide in its territory for the enforcement of such award.</p>

        <p>The Contracting Parties agree to consult promptly, on the request of either, on any matter relating to the interpretation or application of this Agreement.

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Settlement of disputes between contracting parties">
        <p>1. Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement should, if possible, be settled by consultations and negotiations through diplomatic channels.</p>
        <p>2. If a dispute between the Contracting Parties cannot be settled in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article within six months from the date of request for settlement, the dispute shall upon the request of either Contracting Party be submitted to an arbitral tribunal of three members.</p>
        <p>3. Such arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way. Within two months from the date of receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the tribunal.

The Chairman shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>4. If within the periods specified in paragraph 3 of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make any necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.

        <p>5. The tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
        <p>6. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be final and binding on both Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>7.

The tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the two Contracting Parties, and this award shall be binding on both Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>8. A dispute shall not be submitted to an international arbitral tribunal under the provisions of this Article, if the same dispute has been brought before another international arbitration tribunal under the provisions of Article 8 and is still before the court. This will not impair the possibility of dispute settlement in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Application of other rules">
        <p>If the provisions of law of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement contain rules, whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by the present Agreement, such rules shall to the extent that they are more favourable prevail over the present Agreement as long as they last.</p>
