        <p>4. Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject investors of the other Contracting Party, as regards their expansion, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments, to treatment less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the investors concerned.</p>

Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the investments affected immediately before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier and shall be paid without undue delay. The compensation shall include interest calculated on the six-month LIBOR basis, from the date of expropriation until the date of full payment.</p>

        <p>2. If a dispute can not be settled amicably within six months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, and without prejudice to the right to use domestic judicial and administrative remedies, the investor shall be entitled to submit the dispute either to:</p>
        <p>a) Ad hoc arbitral tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); or</p>
        <p>b) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter referred to as "the Centre") through conciliation or arbitration established under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature in Washington D.C. on 18 March 1965 (hereinafter referred to as "the Convention").</p>
        <p>3. The arbitration award shall be based on:</p>
        <p>-  The provisions of this Agreement;</p>
        <p>-  The laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment has been made including the rules relative to conflict of laws; and</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Settlement of disputes between contracting parties">
        <p>1. Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement should, if possible, be settled by consultations and negotiations through diplomatic channels.</p>
        <p>2. If a dispute between the Contracting Parties cannot be settled in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article within six months from the date of request for settlement, the dispute shall upon the request of either Contracting Party be submitted to an arbitral tribunal of three members.</p>
        <p>3. Such arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way. Within two months from the date of receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the tribunal. Those two members shall then select a national of a third State who on approval by the two Contracting Parties shall be appointed Chairman of the tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>4. If within the periods specified in paragraph 3 of this Article the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make any necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he too is prevented from discharging the said function, the Member of the International Court of Justice next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5. The tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
        <p>6. The arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be final and binding on both Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>7. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings; the cost of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. The tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the two Contracting Parties, and this award shall be binding on both Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>8. A dispute shall not be submitted to an international arbitral tribunal under the provisions of this Article, if the same dispute has been brought before another international arbitration court under the provisions of Article 8 and is still before the court. This will not impair the possibility of dispute settlement in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Consultations and exchange of information">
        <p>1. Upon the request by either Contracting Party, the other Contracting Party shall, without undue delay, begin consultations concerning interpretation and application of this Agreement.</p>
        <p>2. Upon the request by either Contracting Party, information shall be exchanged on the impact that the laws, regulations, decisions, administrative practices or procedures or policies of the other Contracting Party may have on investments covered by this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Application of other rules">
        <p>If the provisions of law of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement contain rules, whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by the present Agreement, such rules shall to the extent that they are more favourable prevail over the present Agreement as long as they last.</p>
