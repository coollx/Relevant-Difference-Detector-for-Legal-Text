        <p>1.  Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create favourable conditions for investors of the other Contracting Party for investment in its territory and admit such investment in accordance with its laws and regulations.</p>
        <p>2.  Investments of investors of either Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.

Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Treatment of investments">
        <p>1.

        <p>2.

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Subrogation">
        <p>If a Contracting Party or its designated Agency makes payment to an investor under a guarantee it has granted to an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the latter Contracting Party shall recognise the transfer of any right or claim of such investor to the former Contracting Party or its designated Agency and recognise the subrogation of the former Contracting Party or its Agency to such a right or claim to the same extent as its predecessor in title.

      <div type="article" num="8" title="Disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1.  Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement should, as far as possible, be settled through negotiations between the Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>2.  If a dispute between the Contracting Parties cannot thus be settled within six months after the beginning of negotiations, it shall upon the request of either Contracting Party be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>3.  Such an arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way:</p>
        <p>(a)  Within three months from the receipt of the request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one member of the tribunal. These two members shall then select a national of a third State who on approval by the Contracting Parties shall be appointed Chairman of the tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>(b)  If within any of the periods specified above the necessary appointments have not been made, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or is prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.

        <p>2.  If the dispute cannot be settled through negotiations within six months from the date of written notification of the dispute, either party to the dispute shall be entitled to submit the dispute to the competent court of the Contracting Party accepting the investment.</p>

Any dispute concerning other matters between an investor of either Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party may be submitted by mutual agreement to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply if either party to the dispute has resorted to the procedure specified in paragraph 2 of this Article.</p>
        <p>4.  The decisions by the arbitral tribunal of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes shall be final and binding on both parties to the dispute. Both Contracting Parties shall commit themselves to the enforcement of the decision in accordance with their respective domestic law.</p>
        <p>5.  An ad hoc arbitral tribunal referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way. Within two months of the receipt of the request for arbitration, each party to the dispute shall appoint one member of the tribunal. Those two members shall then select a national of a third State which has diplomatic relations with the two Contracting Parties as Chairman. The Chairman shall be selected within two months from the date of appointment of the other two members. If within the period specified above the tribunal has not been constituted, either party to the dispute may invite the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes to make the necessary appointments.

        <p>6.  The ad hoc arbitral tribunal shall determine its own procedure. However, the tribunal may, in the course of determination of procedure, take as guidance the Arbitration Rules of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.</p>
        <p>7.  The ad hoc arbitral tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be final and binding on both parties to the dispute. Both Contracting Parties shall commit themselves to the enforcement of the decision in accordance with their respective domestic law.</p>
        <p>8.

        <p>9.  Each party to the dispute shall bear the cost of its own member of the ad hoc arbit-ral tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings. The cost of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the parties to the dispute.</p>
