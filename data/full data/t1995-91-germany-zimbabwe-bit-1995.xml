      <p>b) Without prejudice to any other method of determining nationality, in particular, any person in possession of a national passport issued by the competent authorities of the Contracting Party concerned shall be deemed to be a national of that Party.</p>
      <p>(2) Ad Article 2</p>
      <p>a) Investments made in accordance with the laws of either Contracting Party within the territory of that Contracting Party by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party shall enjoy the full protection of the Agreement</p>

      <p>b) The provisions of Article 3 do not oblige a Contracting Party to extend to natural persons or companies resident in the territory of the other Contracting Party tax privileges, tax exemptions and tax reductions which according to its tax laws are granted only to natural persons and companies resident in its territory.</p>
      <p>c)  The Contracting Parties shall within the framework of their national legislation give sympathetic consideration to applications for the entry and sojourn of persons of either Contracting Party who wish to enter the territory of the other Contracting Party in connection with an investment; the same shall apply to employed persons of either Contracting Party who in connection with an investment wish to enter the territory of the other Contracting Party and sojourn there to take up employment. Applications for work permits shall also be given sympathetic consideration.</p>
      <p>(4) Ad Article 4</p>
      <p>A claim to compensation shall also exist when, as a result of State intervention in the company in which the investment is made, its economic substance is severely impaired.</p>
      <p>(5) Ad Article 5</p>
      <p>With respect to the Republic of Zimbabwe the obligation to guarantee the free transfer of payments in connection with an investment shall apply as follows:</p>
      <p>The proceeds referred to in paragraph (e) of Article 5 shall be:</p>
      <p>a) Fully and freely transferable in the case of investments made on or after the 1st May, 1993.</p>
      <p>b) Transferable by way of instalments over a period not exceeding 18 months in the case of investments made before the 1st May, 1993: provided that</p>
      <p>i) Not less than 50% of the total proceeds shall be transferable at the time when the application for the transfer is made, 25% of the proceeds shall be transferable 9 months after such application, and the remaining 25% of the proceeds shall be transferable 18 months after such application;</p>
      <p>ii) Each instalment shall be transferred in a freely convertible currency at the rate of exchange applicable on the date of transfer; and</p>
      <p>iii) Any remaining balance of the proceeds which is not transferred shall, until it is transferred as aforesaid, be retained in Zimbabwe in an account denominated in local currency and shall accrue interest at the prevailing local market rate.</p>
      <p>(6) Ad Article 6</p>
      <p>A transfer shall be deemed to have been made "without delay" within the meaning of Article 6 (1) if effected within such period as is normally required for the completion of transfer formalities. The said period shall commence on the day on which the relevant request has been submitted and may on no account exceed two months.</p>
      <p>(7) Ad Article 7</p>
      <p>Whenever goods or persons connected with an investment are to be transported, each Contracting Party shall neither exclude nor hinder transport enterprises of the other Contracting Party and shall issue such permits as may be required to carry out such transport.</p>
