        <p>1. Any dispute arising directly from an investment between a Contracting Party and investors from the other Contracting Party shall be settled amicably.</p>
        <p>2. If a solution is not reached after six months from the date on which the problem was raised by one of the Parties, it may be settled, following a request submitted by one of the Parties in dispute, in the competent court in whose territory or maritime area the investment is made.</p>
        <p>3. If the dispute is based on the amount of compensation stipulated in paragraph 2 Article 3 above and has not been settled amicably after a period of six months from the date on which it was raised by one of the Parties in dispute, each Party shall have the right to submit the said dispute to an arbitral tribunal which shall be composed for each specific case of three members designated as follows:</p>
        <p>Within two months from the date of filing of the request for arbitration, each Party shall appoint one member to the tribunal.</p>
        <p>Within two months of their designation, the two Parties shall appoint a third member who shall act as President of the tribunal, provided that the said President shall be a national of a third country having diplomatic relations with both Parties. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply in the event that the investor elects to have recourse to the competent tribunal referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article.</p>
        <p>If it has not been possible to make such a designation within the specific periods of the above-mentioned section, each Party in dispute may invite the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) to make the necessary designations.</p>
        <p>The Tribunal shall take its decisions by majority vote and its decisions shall be final and legally binding on the Contracting Parties. Each Party shall bear the cost of its arbitrator to the Tribunal and the costs of his representation in the arbitral proceedings. The two Parties in dispute shall share equitably the amounts to be paid to the President of the Tribunal and other expenses unless the Tribunal decides otherwise. The Tribunal in its proceedings shall apply the principles of arbitration of "UNCITRAL" and shall also apply, with respect to the issue in dispute, the laws of the Contracting country in whose territory or maritime zone the investment was made. The place of arbitration shall be the seat of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague (The Netherlands).</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Settlement of disputes between the parties">
        <p>1. The two Contracting Parties shall endeavour, in good faith and in mutual cooperation, to reach a rapid and fair settlement of any dispute arising between them over the interpretation, execution or termination of this Agreement. To this end, the two Parties hereby agree to reach such settlement through direct objective negotiations. If the dispute has not been settled after six months from the date on which the problem was raised by one of the Contracting Parties, it may be submitted, at the request of either Contracting Party, to a three-member arbitral tribunal.</p>
        <p>2. Within a period of two months following the date of receipt of the said request, each Contracting Party shall appoint one arbitrator and the two appointed arbitrators shall appoint the third, who must be a national of a third country, to be the President of the tribunal. If one of the Contracting Parties is unable to appoint its arbitrator at the end of a specific period, the other Contracting Party may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint an arbitrator.</p>
        <p>3. If the two arbitrators are unable to agree on the choice of the President within two months of their appointment, the President shall be appointed at the request of either Contracting Party by the President of the International Court of Justice.</p>
        <p>4. If the President of the International Court of Justice is prevented from carrying out his functions as stipulated in the two preceding paragraphs (2 and 3) of this Article, or if the President of the International Court of Justice is a national of one of the Contracting Parties, the decision of appointment shall be taken by the Vice-President of the International Court of Justice. If, however, the Vice-President is prevented from carrying out the said function or if he is a national of one of the Contracting Parties, then the decision of appointment shall be taken by a member immediately following the Vice-President in order of precedence, provided that he is not a national of one of the Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>5. The Tribunal shall take its decisions by a majority of votes. Its decisions shall be final and binding on the Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>The Tribunal, in its proceedings, shall apply the principles of UNCITRAL and, in relation to the merits of the dispute, it shall apply the rules of this Agreement and the rules of International Law whenever necessary. The place of arbitration shall be The Hague (Netherlands) or Stockholm (Sweden).</p>
        <p>6. All claims to be submitted and all hearing sessions shall be completed within eight months from the date of appointment of the third arbitrator unless otherwise decided. The Tribunal shall publish its decision in two months from the date of the submission of the last claims or from the date of closure of the general sessions.</p>
        <p>7. Both Parties shall share equitably all costs of the chairman, the two arbitrators and the costs of the other proceedings. However, the Tribunal may decide to have the Parties pay a higher percentage of the costs.</p>
        <p>8. It shall not be permitted to submit a dispute to an arbitral tribunal in accordance with the rules of this Article if the same dispute has already been submitted to another arbitral tribunal under the rules of Article 9 above and is still being heard by that tribunal. However, this shall not affect the commencement of direct and constructive negotiations between the Contracting Parties.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="11" title="Entry into force">
        <p>1. The present Agreement shall enter into force on the date on which the instruments of ratification have been exchanged through diplomatic channels. It shall remain in force for a period of ten years and shall continue to be valid unless it is terminated in accordance with paragraph 2 of this article. It shall apply to investments existing at the time of entry into force and to investments made or acquired thereafter.</p>
        <p>2. Either Contracting Party may, by giving one year's written notice to the other Contracting Party, terminate this Agreement at the end of the initial ten-year period or at any time thereafter.</p>
        <p>3. This Agreement may be amended by written agreement between the two Parties. Any amendment shall enter into force when each Party has notified the other that it has fulfilled all the conditions for the entry into force of that amendment.</p>
        <p>4. Upon termination of this Agreement, any investment made prior to the date of such termination shall be governed by the rules of this Agreement and shall enjoy the protection established under those rules for a period of ten years from the date of termination.</p>
