        <p>2.  Investments made by investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>3.  Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="3" title="Treatment of investments">
        <p>1.  Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investments and returns of investors of the other Contracting Party treatment which is fair and equitable and no less favourable than that which it accords to investments and returns of its own investors or to investments and returns of investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to investors.</p>
        <p>2.  Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investors of the other Contracting Party as regards the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of</p>
        <p>Their investments, treatment which is fair and equitable and no less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to investors.</p>

Resulting payments shall be freely transferable without undue delay.</p>

      <div type="article" num="5" title="Expropriation">
        <p>1.  Investments of investors of one Contracting Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated or otherwise subject to any other measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as "expropriation') in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for public purposes and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. The expropriation shall be carried out on a non-discriminatory</p>
        <p>Basis in accordance with legal procedures.</p>
        <p>2.  Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the expropriated investments immediately before the date when the expropriation was made or before the date when the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, shall include interest at the applicable commercial rate from the date of expropriation until the date of payment, and shall be made without undue delay, be effectively realizable, and be freely transferable. In both expropriation and compensation, treatment no less favourable than that which the Contracting Party accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State shall be accorded.</p>
        <p>3.  Investors of one Contracting Party affected by expropriation shall have a right to prompt review by a judicial or other independent authority of the other Contracting Party of their case and of the valuation of their investments in accordance with the principles set out in this Article.</p>
        <p>4.  Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is incorporated or constituted under its laws and regulations, and in which investors of the other Contracting Party participate or own shares or debentures, the provisions of this Article shall be applied.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="6" title="Transfers">
        <p>1.  Each Contracting Party shall guarantee to investors of the other Contracting Party the free transfer of their investments and returns. Such transfers shall include, in particular, though not exclusively:</p>
        <p>(a)  net profit, capital gains, dividends, interest, royalties, fees and any other current income accruing from investments;</p>
        <p>(b)  proceeds accruing from the sale of the total or partial liquidation of investments;</p>
        <p>(c)  funds in repayment of loans related to investments;</p>

        <p>(e)  compensation pursuant to Articles 4 and 5.</p>
        <p>2.  All transfers under this Agreement shall be made in a freely convertible currency, without undue restriction or delay, at the market exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transfer.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="7" title="Subrogation">
        <p>1.  If a Contracting Party or its designated agency makes a payment to its own investors under an indemnity given in respect of investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party, other Contracting Party shall recognize:</p>
        <p>(a)  assignment, whether under the law or pursuant to a legal transaction in that State, of any rights or claims from investors to the former Contracting Party or</p>
        <p>Its designated agency, and</p>
        <p>(b)  that the former Contracting Party or its designated agency is entitled by virtue of subrogation to exercise the rights and enforce the claims of those investors.</p>
        <p>2.  The subrogated rights or claims shall not exceed the original rights or claims of the investor.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="8" title="Settlement of disputes between the contracting parties">
        <p>1.  Disputes between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement should as far as possible be settled by the two Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>2.  If a dispute cannot thus be settled within a period of six (6) months from the date on which the matter was raised by either Contracting Party, it shall upon the request of either Contracting Party be submitted to an arbitration tribunal.</p>
        <p>3.  Such arbitration tribunal shall be constituted ad hoc as follows: each Contracting Party shall appoint one member, and these two members shall agree upon a national of a third State as their chairman to be appointed by the two Contracting Parties. Such members shall be appointed within three (3) months, and such chairman within five (5) months from the date on which either Contracting Party has informed the other Contracting Party that it intends to submit the dispute to an arbitration tribunal.</p>
        <p>4.  If the periods specified in paragraph 3 above have not been observed, either Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other arrangement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President should make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he, too, is prevented from discharging the said function, the member of the Court next in seniority who is not a national of either Contracting Party should make the necessary appointments.</p>
        <p>5.  The arbitration tribunal shall reach its decisions by a majority of votes. Such decisions shall be binding. Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own member and of its representatives in the arbitration proceedings; the cost of the chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. The arbitration tribunal may make a different regulation concerning costs. In all other respects, the arbitration tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
        <p>6.  The chairman of the arbitration tribunal shall be a national of a third State with which both Contracting Parties maintain diplomatic relations.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="9" title="Settlement of disputes between a contracting party and an investor of the other">
        <p>Contracting Party</p>
        <p>1.  Disputes concerning investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party shall as far as possible be settled amicably between the parties in</p>
        <p>Dispute.</p>
        <p>2.  The local remedies under the laws and regulations of one Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment has been made shall be available to investors of the other Contracting Party on the basis of treatment no less favourable than that accorded to investments of its own investors or investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to investors.</p>
        <p>3.  If any dispute cannot be settled within six (6) months from the date on which the dispute has been raised by either Party and if the investor of the other Contracting Party waives the rights to initiate any proceedings under paragraph 2 of this Article with respect to the same dispute, it shall, at the request of the investor of the other Contracting Party, be submitted to an ad hoc Arbitral Tribunal in accordance with the provisions of this Article.</p>
        <p>4.  Such an Arbitral Tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following</p>
        <p>Way: Within three (3) months from the date of receipt of the request for arbitration, each party shall appoint one member of the Tribunal. These two members shall then select a national of a third State, who, on approval of both parties, shall be appointed Chairman of</p>
        <p>The Tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within three (3) months from the date of</p>
        <p>Appointment of the other two members.</p>
        <p>5.  If, within the periods specified in paragraph (4) of this Article, the necessary appointments have not been made, a request may be made by either party to the Secretary-General of the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) to make such appointments.</p>
        <p>6.  The Arbitral Tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be binding on each party. The award shall be enforced in accordance with domestic law.</p>
        <p>7.  The Arbitral Tribunal shall determine its own procedure.</p>
        <p>8.  Each party shall bear the costs of its own arbitrator and its representation in the</p>
        <p>Arbitral proceedings. The costs of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by both parties. The Arbitral Tribunal may make a different regulation concerning costs.</p>
        <p>9.  In the event of both Contracting Parties having become Contracting States of the Convention of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, disputes under this Article between the parties in dispute shall be submitted for arbitration under the aforementioned Convention, unless the parties in dispute agree otherwise; each Contracting Party herewith declares its acceptance of such a procedure.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="10" title="Application of other rules">
        <p>1.  Where a matter is governed simultaneously both by this Agreement and by another international agreement to which both Contracting Parties are parties, or by general</p>
        <p>Principles of international law, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent either Contracting Party or any of its investors from taking advantage of whichever rules are the more favourable to its case.</p>
        <p>2.  If the treatment to be accorded by one Contracting Party to investors of the other Contracting Party in accordance with its laws and regulations or other specific provisions or contracts is more favourable than that accorded by this Agreement, the more favourable treatment shall be accorded.</p>
