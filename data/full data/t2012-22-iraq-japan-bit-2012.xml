      <div type="article" num="17" title="Settlement of investment disputes between a contracting party and an investor of the other contracting party">
        <p>1.  For the purposes of this Article, an "investment dispute" is a dispute between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party that has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, an alleged breach of any obligation of the former Contracting Party under this Agreement with respect to the investor of that other Contracting Party or its investments in the Area of the former Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>2.  Subject to subparagraph 7(b), nothing in this Article shall be construed so as to prevent an investor who is a party to an investment dispute (hereinafter referred to in this Article as "disputing investor") from seeking administrative or judicial settlement within the Area of the Contracting Party that is a party to the investment dispute (hereinafter referred to in this Article as "disputing Party").</p>
        <p>3.  Any investment dispute shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably through consultations between the disputing investor and the disputing Party (hereinafter referred to in this Article as "the disputing parties").</p>
        <p>4.  If the investment dispute cannot be settled through such consultations within three months from the date on which the disputing investor requested in writing the disputing Party for consultations, the disputing investor may, subject to subparagraph 7(a), submit the investment dispute to one of the following international conciliations or arbitrations:</p>
        <p>(a)  conciliation or arbitration in accordance with the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965 (hereinafter referred to in this Article as "the ICSID Convention"), so long as the ICSID Convention is in force between the Contracting Parties;</p>
        <p>(b)  conciliation or arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, so long as the ICSID Convention is not in force between the Contracting Parties;</p>
        <p>(c)  arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law; and</p>
        <p>(d)  if agreed with the disputing Party, any arbitration in accordance with other arbitration rules.</p>
        <p>5.  (a) Except for investment disputes regarding the</p>
        <p>Obligation of the disputing Party under paragraph 3 of Article 5, each Contracting Party hereby consents to the submission of investment disputes by a disputing investor to conciliation or arbitration set forth in paragraph 4 chosen by the disputing investor.</p>
        <p>(b)  For investment disputes regarding the obligation of the disputing Party under paragraph 3 of Article 5, necessary consent for the submission to the conciliation or arbitration will be given by the disputing Party on a case-by-case basis.</p>
        <p>6.  Notwithstanding paragraph 5, no investment disputes may be submitted to conciliation or arbitration set forth in paragraph 4, if more than five years have elapsed since the date on which the disputing investor acquired or should have first acquired, whichever is the earlier, the knowledge that the disputing investor had incurred loss or damage referred to in paragraph 1.</p>
        <p>7.  (a) In the event that an investment dispute has been</p>
        <p>Submitted to courts of justice or administrative tribunals or agencies or any other binding dispute settlement mechanism established under the laws and regulations of the disputing Party, any conciliation or arbitration set forth in paragraph 4 can be sought only if the disputing investor withdraws, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the disputing Party, its claim from such domestic remedies before the final decisions are made therein.</p>
        <p>(b)  In the event that an investment dispute has been submitted for resolution under one of the conciliations or arbitrations set forth in paragraph 4, the same dispute shall not be submitted for resolution under courts of justice, administrative tribunals or agencies or any other binding dispute settlement mechanism established under the laws and regulations of the disputing Party.</p>
        <p>8.  The disputing Party shall deliver to the other Contracting Party:</p>
        <p>(a)  written notice of the investment dispute submitted to the arbitration no later than thirty (30) days after the date on which the investment dispute was submitted; and</p>
        <p>(b)  copies of all pleadings filed in the arbitration.</p>
        <p>9.  The Contracting Party which is not the disputing Party may, upon written notice to the disputing parties, make submissions to the arbitral tribunal on a question of interpretation of this Agreement.</p>
        <p>10.  Unless the disputing parties agree otherwise, the arbitration shall be held in a country that is a party to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York, June 10, 1958.</p>
        <p>11.  The award rendered by the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding upon the disputing parties. This award shall be executed by the applicable laws and regulations concerning the execution of award in force in the country where such execution is sought.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="18" title="Prudential measures">
        <p>1.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, a Contracting Party shall not be prevented from taking measures relating to financial services for prudential reasons, including measures for the protection of investors, depositors, policy holders or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed by a juridical person supplying financial services, or to ensure the integrity and stability of its financial system.</p>
        <p>2.  Where the measures taken by a Contracting Party pursuant to paragraph 1 do not conform with this Agreement, they shall not be used as a means of avoiding the obligations of the Contracting Party under this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="19" title="Intellectual property rights">
        <p>1.  The Contracting Parties shall grant and ensure adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights, and promote efficiency and transparency in administrations of intellectual property protection system. For this purpose, the Contracting Parties shall promptly consult with each other at the request of either Contracting Party. Depending on the results of the consultations, each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with its applicable laws and regulations, take appropriate measures to remove the factors which are recognised as having adverse effects to the investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.</p>
        <p>2.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed so as to derogate from the rights and obligations under multilateral agreements in respect of protection of intellectual property rights to which the Contracting Parties are parties.</p>
        <p>3.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed so as to oblige either Contracting Party to extend to investors of the other Contracting Party and their investments treatment accorded to investors of a non-Contracting Party and their investments by virtue of multilateral agreements in respect of protection of intellectual property rights, to which the former Contracting Party is a party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="20" title="Taxation">
        <p>1.  Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the rights and obligations of either Contracting Party under any tax convention. In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and any such convention, that convention shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.</p>
        <p>2.  Paragraph 1 of Article 3 does not prevent either Contracting Party from differentiating between treatments accorded in accordance with its laws and regulations relating to taxes.</p>
        <p>3.  Paragraph 1 and 2 of Article 4 shall not be construed so as to oblige a Contracting Party to extend to investors of the other Contracting Party special tax advantages accorded to investors of a non-Contracting Party, on the basis of reciprocity with the non-Contracting Party or by virtue of any agreement relating to taxes in force between the former Contracting Party and the non-Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="21" title="Joint committee">
        <p>1.  The Contracting Parties shall establish a Joint Committee (hereinafter referred to as "the Committee") with a view to accomplishing the objectives of this Agreement. The functions of the Committee shall be:</p>
        <p>(a)  to discuss and review the implementation and operation of this Agreement; and</p>
        <p>(b)  to share information on and to discuss any other investment-related matters concerning this Agreement, for the purpose of encouraging favourable conditions for investors of the Contracting Parties.</p>
        <p>2.  The Committee may, as necessary, make appropriate recommendations by consensus to the Contracting Parties for the more effective functioning or the attainment of the objectives of this Agreement.</p>
        <p>3.  The Committee shall be composed of representatives of the Governments of the Contracting Parties. The Committee may, upon mutual consent of the Contacting Parties, invite representatives of relevant entities other than the Governments of the Contracting Parties with the necessary expertise relevant to the issues to be discussed, and hold joint meetings with the private sectors.</p>
        <p>4.  The Committee shall determine its own rules of procedure to carry out its functions.</p>
        <p>5.  The Committee may establish sub-committees and delegate specific tasks to such sub-committees.</p>
        <p>6.  The Committee and the sub-committee established pursuant to paragraph 5 shall meet upon the request of either Contracting Party.</p>
      </div>

        <p>Each Contracting Party recognises that it is inappropriate to encourage investment by investors of the other Contracting Party and of a non-Contracting Party by relaxing its health, safety or environmental measures, or by lowering its labour standards. To this effect each Contracting Party should not waive or otherwise derogate from such measures and standards as an encouragement for the establishment, acquisition or expansion of investments in its Area by investors of the other Contracting Party and of a non-Contracting Party.</p>

        <p>2.  Subject to prior notification and consultation, a Contracting Party may deny the benefits of this Agreement to an investor of the other Contracting Party that is a juridical person of the other Contracting Party and to its investments if the juridical person is owned or controlled by an investor of a non-Contracting Party and the juridical person has no substantial business activities in the Area of the other Contracting Party.</p>
