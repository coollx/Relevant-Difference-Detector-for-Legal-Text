      <div type="article" num="II" title="Promotion and acceptance">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall encourage investors of the other Contracting Party to make investments in its territory and admit such investments in accordance with its laws and regulations.</p>
        <p>2.

        <p>3. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord investors of the other Contracting Party, as regards the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, or disposal of their investments, treatment not less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the investor concerned.</p>
        <p>4. The treatment of the most favoured nation according to this Article shall not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to investors of the other the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from:</p>
        <p>(a) Any existing or future free trade area, customs union, common market, economic union, or any similar regional economic organisation, to which either Contracting Party is or may become a party, or</p>
        <p>(b) Any international agreement relating wholly or mainly to taxation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="IV" title="Expropriation">
        <p>1. Neither Contracting Party shall take measures of expropriation, nationalization or dispossession, either direct or any measure equivalent thereto against investments belonging to investors of the other Contracting Party, unless the measures are taken in the public interest, public use or in the interest of the national defense on a non-discriminatory basis and under due process of law and upon payment of just compensation.</p>
        <p>2. Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the impending expropriation becomes public knowledge. The compensation shall be made without undue delay, and shall be effectively realizable and freely transferable.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="V" title="Compensation">
        <p>If a Contracting Party makes restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement for losses suffered owing to war, revolution, state of the nation emergency, revolt, insurrection, riot, or other armed conflicts in the territory of such Contracting Party, it shall accord to the investors of the other Contracting Party whose investments in the territory of the former have suffered such losses, treatment no less favourable than that which the Contracting Party shall accord to the investors of any third State. Resulting payments shall be freely transferable.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="article" num="VI" title="Transfers">
        <p>1. Each Contracting Party shall, subject to its laws and regulations, guarantee the investors of the other Contracting Party the transfer of their investments and returns held in the territory of the Contracting Party first mentioned:</p>

      </div>
      <div type="article" num="VII" title="Subrogation">
        <p>In case one Contracting Party has granted any issuance or guarantee agreement against non-commercial risks in respect of an investment made by its own investors in the territory of the other Contracting Party and has made payments to such investors under the guarantee, the other Party shall recognize the transfer of the economic rights of the investors to the said Contracting Party. The subrogation will make it possible for one Contracting Party to receive payments for compensation that the investor would have been entitled to. This does not necessarily imply, however, a recognition on the part of the other Contracting Party of the merits of any case or the amount of any claim arising therefrom.</p>
        <p>In respect of property rights or any other rights derived from ownership of the investment, subrogation will take place after the legal requirements of the host Party of the investment have been met.</p>
