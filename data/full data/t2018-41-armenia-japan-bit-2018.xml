          <p>1. In the event of an investment dispute between the claimant and the respondent, they should initially seek to resolve the dispute through consultation and negotiation, which may include the use of non-binding, third-party procedures. </p>
          <p>2. In the event that a disputing party considers that an investment dispute cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation: </p>
          <p>(a) the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this Article a claim: </p>
          <p>(i) that the respondent has breached: </p>
          <p>(A) an obligation under Chapter I; or </p>
          <p>(B) an investment agreement to which the claimant is a party; and </p>
          <p>(ii) that the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach; and </p>
          <p>(b) the claimant, on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a legal person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Article a claim: </p>
          <p>(i) that the respondent has breached: </p>
          <p>(A) an obligation under Chapter I; or </p>
          <p>(B) an investment agreement to which the enterprise is a party; and </p>
          <p>(ii) that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach. </p>
          <p>3. At least ninety days before submitting any claim to </p>
          <p>arbitration under this Article, a claimant shall deliver to the respondent a written notice of its intention to submit the claim to arbitration (hereinafter referred to as "notice of intent"). The notice of intent shall specify: </p>
          <p>(a) the name and address of the claimant and, in the case of subparagraph 2(b), the name, address and place of incorporation of the enterprise; </p>
          <p>(b) for each claim, the provision of Chapter I or of investment agreement alleged to have been breached and any other relevant provisions; </p>
          <p>(c) the legal and factual basis for each claim; and </p>
          <p>(d) the relief sought and the approximate amount of damages claimed. </p>
          <p>4. Provided that six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to the claim, a claimant may submit a claim referred to in paragraph 2 to the arbitration: </p>
          <p>(a) under the ICSID Convention, provided that both Contracting Parties are parties to the ICSID Convention; </p>
          <p>(b) under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, provided that either Contracting Party, but not both, is a party to the ICSID Convention; </p>
          <p>(c) under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules; or </p>
          <p>(d) if the disputing parties agree, under any other arbitration institution or arbitration rules. </p>
          <p>5. A claim shall be deemed submitted to arbitration under this Article when the claimant's notice of or request for arbitration (hereinafter referred to in this Article as "notice of arbitration"): </p>
          <p>(a) referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 36 of the ICSID Convention is received by the Secretary- General of ICSID; </p>

          <p>(d) under any other arbitration institution or arbitration rules selected under subparagraph 4(d) is received by the respondent, unless otherwise specified by such institution or in such rules. </p>

In the case of a claim submitted pursuant to subparagraph 2(a) (i) (B) or 2(b) (i) (B), if the investment agreement provides a provision that designates forum for dispute settlement, such provision shall not be construed as the revocation or exclusion of such consent with respect to a claim alleging a breach of the investment agreement. </p>
          <p>7. Notwithstanding paragraph 6, no claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Article if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under paragraph 2 and knowledge that the claimant in the case of subparagraph 2(a) or the enterprise referred to in subparagraph 2(b) in the case of that subparagraph has incurred loss or damage. </p>
          <p>8. No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Article unless: </p>
          <p>(a) in the case of subparagraph 2(a): </p>
          <p>(i) the claimant consents in writing to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Article; and </p>
          <p>(ii) the claimant waives in writing any right to initiate or continue before any court under the law of either Contracting Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in subparagraph 2(a) (i); and </p>

          <p>(ii) both the claimant and the enterprise referred to in that subparagraph waive in writing any right to initiate or continue before any court under the law of either Contracting Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in subparagraph 2 (b) (i). </p>
          <p>9. The waiver provided pursuant to subparagraph 8(a) (ii) or 8(b) (ii) shall cease to apply where the arbitral tribunal rejects the claim on the basis of a failure to meet the requirements of paragraph 3, 4, 7 or 8, or on any other procedural or jurisdictional grounds. </p>
          <p>10. Notwithstanding subparagraphs 8(a) (ii) and 8(b) (ii), the claimant or the enterprise referred to in subparagraph 2(b) may initiate or continue an action that seeks interim injunctive relief that does not involve the payment of monetary damages before a court under the law of the respondent. </p>
          <p>11. (a) When a claim is submitted under paragraph 2(a) (i) (A) or 2(b) (i) (A), the tribunal shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law. </p>
          <p>(b) When a claim is submitted under paragraph 2(a) (i) (B) or 2(b) (i) (B), the tribunal shall apply: </p>
          <p>(i) the rules of law specified in the pertinent investment agreement, or as the disputing parties may otherwise agree; or </p>
          <p>(ii) if the rules of law have not been specified or otherwise agreed, the law of the respondent, including its rules on the conflict of laws. </p>
          <p>12. The respondent shall deliver to the non-disputing Party: </p>
          <p>(a) notice of arbitration no later than thirty days after the date on which the claim was submitted; and </p>
          <p>(b) copies of all pleadings filed in the arbitration. </p>
          <p>13. The non-disputing Party may, upon written notice to the disputing parties, make submissions to the arbitral tribunal on a question of interpretation of this Agreement. </p>
          <p>14. In an arbitration under this Article, the respondent shall not assert, as a defence, counterclaim, right of setoff or otherwise, that the claimant has received or will receive indemnification or other compensation for all or part of the alleged damages pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract. </p>
          <p>15. The arbitral tribunal may award only: </p>
          <p>(a) a judgement whether or not there has been a breach by the respondent of any obligation under Chapter I or under an investment agreement referred to in subparagraph 2(a) (i) (B) or 2(b) (i) (B) with respect to the claimant and its investments; and </p>
          <p>(b) one or both of the following remedies, only if there has been such a breach: </p>
          <p>(i) monetary damages and applicable interest; and </p>
          <p>(ii) restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide that the respondent may pay monetary damages and any applicable interest, in lieu of restitution. </p>
          <p>The arbitral tribunal may also award cost and attorney's fees in accordance with applicable arbitration rules. </p>
          <p>16. Subject to paragraph 15, in the case of subparagraph 2(b): </p>
          <p>(a) an award of monetary damages and any applicable interest shall provide that the sum be paid to the enterprise referred to in that subparagraph; </p>
          <p>(b) an award of restitution of property shall provide that restitution be made to the enterprise referred to in that subparagraph; and </p>
          <p>(c) the award shall provide that it is made without prejudice to any right that any natural person or enterprise may have in the relief under applicable law. </p>
          <p>17. The respondent may make available to the public ina timely manner all documents, including an award, submitted to, or issued by, an arbitral tribunal established under paragraph 4, subject to redaction of: </p>
          <p>(a) confidential business information; </p>
          <p>(b) information which is privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure under the laws and regulations of either Contracting Party; and </p>
          <p>(c) information which shall be withheld pursuant to the relevant arbitration rules. </p>
          <p>18. Unless the disputing parties agree otherwise, the place of arbitration shall be in a country that is a party to the New York Convention. </p>
